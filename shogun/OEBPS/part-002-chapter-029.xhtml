      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">“Anjin-san?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Hai</i>?” Blackthorne swooped out of a deep sleep.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Here’s some food. And cha.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">For a moment he could not remember who he was or where he was. Then he recognized his cabin aboard the galley. A shaft of sunlight was piercing the darkness. He felt greatly rested. There was no drumbeat now and even in his deepest sleep, his senses had told him that the anchor was being lowered and his ship was safe, near shore, the sea gentle.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He saw a maid carrying a tray, Mariko beside her—her arm no longer in a sling—and he was lying in the pilot’s bunk, the same that he had used during the Rodrigues voyage from Anjiro village to Osaka and that was now, in a way, almost as familiar as his own bunk and cabin aboard <i>Erasmus. Erasmus! </i> It’ll be grand to be back aboard and to see the lads again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He stretched luxuriously, then took the cup of cha Mariko offered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Thank you. That’s delicious. How’s your arm?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Much better, thank you.” Mariko flexed it to show him. “It was just a flesh wound.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You’re looking better, Mariko-san.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, I’m better now.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">When she had come back aboard at dawn with Toranaga she had been near fainting. “Better to stay aloft,” he had told her. “The sickness will leave you faster.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master asks—asks why the pistol shot?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It was just a game pilots play,” he had told her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master compliments you on your seamanship.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We were lucky. The moon helped. And the crew were marvelous. Mariko-san, would you ask the Captain-san if he knows these waters? Sorry, but tell Toranaga-sama I can’t keep awake much longer. Or can we hove to for an hour or so out to sea? I’ve got to sleep.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">He vaguely remembered her telling him that Toranaga said he could go below, that the Captain-san was quite capable as they would be staying in coastal waters and not going out to sea.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne stretched again and opened a cabin porthole. A rocky shore was two hundred-odd yards away. “Where are we?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Off the coast of Totomi Province, Anjin-san. Lord Toranaga wanted to swim and to rest the oarsmen for a few hours. We’ll be at Anjiro tomorrow.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“The fishing village? That’s impossible. It’s near noon and at dawn we were off Osaka. It’s impossible!”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ah, that was yesterday, Anjin-san. You’ve slept a day and a night and half another day,” she replied. “Lord Toranaga said to let you sleep. Now he thinks a swim would be good to wake you up. After food.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Food was two bowls of rice and charcoal-roasted fish with the dark, salt-bitter, vinegar-sweet sauce that she had told him was made from fermented beans.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Thank you—yes, I’d like a swim. Almost thirty-six hours? No wonder I feel fine.” He took the tray from the maid, ravenous. But he did not eat at once. “Why is she afraid?” he asked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“She’s not, Anjin-san. Just a little nervous. Please excuse her. She’s never seen a foreigner close to before.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Tell her when the moon’s full, barbarians sprout horns and fire comes out of our mouths like dragons.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mariko laughed. “I certainly will not.” She pointed to the sea table. “There is tooth powder and a brush and water and fresh towels.” Then said in Latin, “It pleasures me to see thou art well. It is as was related on the march, thou hast great bravery.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Their eyes locked and then the moment was allowed to pass. She bowed politely. The maid bowed. The door closed behind them.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Don’t think about her, he ordered himself. Think about Toranaga or Anjiro. Why do we stop at Anjiro tomorrow? To off-load Yabu? Good riddance!</p>
      <p class="subsq">Omi will be at Anjiro. What about Omi?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Why not ask Toranaga for Omi’s head? He owes you a favor or two. Or why not ask to fight Omi-san. How? With pistols or with swords? You’d have no chance with a sword and it’d be murder if you had a gun. Better to do nothing and wait. You’ll have a chance soon and then you’ll be revenged on both of them. You bask in Toranaga’s favor now. Be patient. Ask yourself what you need from him. Soon we’ll be in Yedo, so you’ve not much time. What about Toranaga?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne was using the chopsticks as he had seen the men in the prison use them, lifting the bowl of rice to his lips and pushing the tacky rice from the lip of the bowl into his mouth with the sticks. The pieces of fish were more difficult. He was still not deft enough, so he used his fingers, glad to eat alone, knowing that to eat with his fingers would be very impolite in front of Mariko or Toranaga or any Japanese.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When every morsel was gone he was still famished.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Got to get more food,” he said aloud. “Jesus God in heaven, I’d like some fresh bread and fried eggs and butter and cheese . . .”</p>
      <p class="subsq">He came on deck. Almost everyone was naked. Some of the men were drying themselves, others sunbathing, and a few were leaping overboard. In the sea alongside the ship, samurai and seamen were swimming or splashing as children would.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Konnichi wa</i>, Anjin-san.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Konnichi wa</i>, Toranaga-sama,” he said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Toranaga, quite naked, was coming up the gangway that had been let down to the sea. “<i>Sonata wa oyogitamo ka?</i>” he said, motioning at the sea, slapping the water off his belly and his shoulders, warm under the bright sun.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Hai</i>, Toranaga-sama, <i>domo</i>,” Blackthorne said, presuming that he was being asked if he wanted to swim.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Again Toranaga pointed at the sea and spoke shortly, then called Mariko to interpret. Mariko walked down from the poopdeck, shielding her head with a crimson sunshade, her informal white cotton kimono casually belted.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Toranaga-sama says you look very rested, Anjin-san. The water’s invigoration.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Invigorating,” he said, correcting her politely. “Yes.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ah, thank you—invigorating. He says please swim then.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Toranaga was leaning carelessly against the gunwale, wiping the water out of his ears with a small towel, and when his left ear would not clear, he hung his head over and hopped on his left heel until it did. Blackthorne saw that Toranaga was very muscular and very taut, apart from his belly. Ill at ease, very conscious of Mariko, he stripped off his shirt and his codpiece and trousers until he was equally naked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga asks if all Englishmen are as hairy as you? The hair so fair?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Some are,” he said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We—our men don’t have hair on their chests or arms like you do. Not very much. He says you’ve a very good build.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“So has he. Please thank him.” Blackthorne walked away from her to the head of the gangplank, aware of her and the young woman, Fujiko, who was kneeling on the poop under a yellow parasol, a maid beside her, also watching him. Then, unable to contain his dignity enough to walk naked all the way down to the sea, he dived over the side into the pale blue water. It was a fine dive and the sea chill reached into him exhilaratingly. The sandy bottom was three fathoms down, seaweed waving, multitudes of fish unfrightened by the swimmers. Near the seabed his plummeting stopped and he twisted and played with the fish, then surfaced and began a seemingly lazy, easy, but very fast overarm stroke for the shore that Alban Caradoc had taught him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The small bay was desolate: many rocks, a tiny pebbled shore, and no sign of life. Mountains climbed a thousand feet to a blue, measureless sky.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He lay on a rock sunning himself. Four samurai had swum with him and were not far away. They smiled and waved. Later he swam back, and they followed. Toranaga was still watching him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He came up on deck. His clothes were gone. Fujiko and Mariko and two maids were still there. One of the maids bowed and offered him a ridiculously small towel, which he took and began to dry himself with, turning uneasily into the gunwale.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I order you to be at ease, he told himself. You’re at ease naked in a locked room with Felicity, aren’t you? It’s only in public when women are around—when she’s around—that you’re embarrassed. Why? They don’t notice nakedness and that’s totally sensible. You’re in Japan. You’re to do as they do. You will be like them and act like a king.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga says you swim very well. Would you teach him that stroke?” Mariko was saying.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’d be glad to,” he said and forced himself to turn around and lean as Toranaga was leaning. Mariko was smiling up at him—looking so pretty, he thought.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“The way you dived into the sea. We’ve—we’ve never seen that before. We always jump. He wants to learn how to do that.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Now?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, please.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I can teach him—at least, I can try.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">A maid was holding a cotton kimono for Blackthorne so, gratefully, he slipped it on, tying it with the belt. Now, completely relaxed, he explained how to dive, how to tuck your head between your arms and spring up and out but to beware of belly flopping.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It’s best to start from the foot of the gangway and sort of fall in head first to begin with, without jumping or running. That’s the way we teach children.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Toranaga listened and asked questions and then, when he was satisfied, he said through Mariko, “Good. I think I understand.” He walked to the head of the gangway. Before Blackthorne could stop him, Toranaga had launched himself toward the water, fifteen feet below. The belly flop was vicious. No one laughed. Toranaga spluttered back to the deck and tried again. Again he landed flat. Other samurai were equally unsuccessful.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It’s not easy,” Blackthorne said. “It took me a long time to learn. Give it a rest and we’ll try again tomorrow.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga says, ‘Tomorrow is tomorrow. Today I will learn how to dive.’ ”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne put his kimono aside and demonstrated again. Samurai aped him. Again they failed. So did Toranaga. Six times.</p>
      <p class="subsq">After another demonstration dive Blackthorne scrambled onto the foot of the gangplank and saw Mariko among them, nude, readying to launch herself into space. Her body was exquisite, the bandage on her upper arm fresh. “Wait, Mariko-san! Better to try from here. The first time.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Very well, Anjin-san.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She walked down to him, the tiny crucifix enhancing her nudity. He showed her how to bend and to fall forward into the sea, catching her by the waist to turn her over so that her head went in first.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Then Toranaga tried near the waterline and was moderately successful. Mariko tried again and the touch of her skin warmed Blackthorne and he clowned momentarily and fell into the water, directing them from there until he had cooled off. Then he ran up to the deck and stood on the gunwale and showed them a deadman’s dive, which he thought might be easier, knowing that it was vital for Toranaga to succeed. “But you’ve got to keep rigid, <i>hai</i>? Like a sword. Then you cannot fail.” He fell outward. The dive was clean and he trod water and waited.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Several samurai came forward but Toranaga waved them aside. He held up his arms stiffly, his backbone straight. His chest and loins were scarlet from the belly flops. Then he let himself fall forward as Blackthorne had shown. His head went into the water first and his legs tumbled over him, but it was a dive and the first successful dive of any of them and a roar of approval greeted him when he surfaced. He did it again, this time better. Other men followed, some successful, others not. Then Mariko tried.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne saw the taut little breasts and tiny waist, flat stomach and curving legs. A flicker of pain went across her face as she lifted her arms above her head. But she held herself like an arrow and fell bravely outward. She speared the water cleanly. Almost no one except him noticed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“That was a fine dive. Really fine,” he said, giving her a hand to lift her easily out of the water onto the gangway platform. “You should stop now. You might open up the cut on your arm.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, thank you, Anjin-san.” She stood beside him, barely reaching his shoulder, very pleased with herself. “That’s a rare sensation, the falling outward and the having to stay stiff, and most of all, the having to dominate your fear. Yes, that was a very rare sensation indeed.” She walked up the companionway and put on the kimono that the maid held out for her. Then, drying her face delicately, she went below.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Christ Jesus, that’s much woman, he thought.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">That sunset Toranaga sent for Blackthorne. He was sitting on the poopdeck on clean futons near a small charcoal brazier upon which small pieces of aromatic wood were smoking. They were used to perfume the air and keep away the dusk gnats and mosquitoes. His kimono was pressed and neat, and the huge, winglike shoulders of the starched overmantle gave him a formidable presence. Yabu, too, was formally dressed, and Mariko. Fujiko was also there. Twenty samurai sat silently on guard. Flares were set into stands and the galley still swung calmly at anchor in the bay.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Saké, Anjin-san?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Domo</i>, Toranaga-sama.” Blackthorne bowed and accepted the small cup from Fujiko, lifted it in toast to Toranaga and drained it. The cup was immediately refilled. Blackthorne was wearing a Brown uniform kimono and it felt easier and freer than his own clothes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga says we’re staying here tonight. Tomorrow we arrive at Anjiro. He would like to hear more about your country and the world outside.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Of course. What would he like to know? It’s a lovely night, isn’t it?” Blackthorne settled himself comfortably, aware of her femininity. Too aware. Strange, I’m more conscious of her now that she’s clothed than when she wore nothing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, very. Soon it will be humid, Anjin-san. Summer is not a good time.” She told Toranaga what she had said. “My Master says to tell you that Yedo is marshy. The mosquitoes are bad in summer, but spring and autumn are beautiful—yes, truly the birth and the dying seasons of the year are beautiful.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“England’s temperate. The winter’s bad perhaps one winter in seven. And the summer also. Famine about once in six years, though sometimes we get two bad years in a row.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We have famine too. All famine is bad. How is it in your country now?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We’ve had bad harvests three times in the last ten years and no sun to ripen the corn. But that’s the Hand of the Almighty. Now England’s very strong. We’re prosperous. Our people work hard. We make all our own cloth, all arms—most of the woolen cloth of Europe. A few silks come from France but the quality’s poor and they’re only for the very rich.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne decided not to tell them about plague or the riots or insurrections caused by enclosing the common lands, and the drift of peasants to towns and to cities. Instead he told them about the good kings and queens, sound leaders and wise parliaments and successful wars.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga wants to be quite clear. You claim only sea power protects you from Spain and Portugal?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes. That alone. Command of our seas keeps us free. You’re an island nation too, just like us. Without command of your seas, aren’t you also defenseless against an outside enemy?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master agrees with you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ah, you’ve been invaded too?” Blackthorne saw a slight frown as she turned to Toranaga and he reminded himself to confine himself to answers and not questions.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When she spoke to him again she was more grave. “Lord Toranaga says I should answer your question, Anjin-san. Yes, we’ve been invaded twice. More than three hundred years ago—it would be 1274 of your counting—the Mongols of Kublai Khan, who had just conquered China and Korea, came against us when we refused to submit to his authority. A few thousand men landed in Kyushu but our samurai managed to contain them, and after a while the enemy withdrew. But seven years later they came again. This time the invasion consisted of almost a thousand Chinese and Korean ships with two hundred thousand enemy troops—Mongols, Chinese, and Korean—mostly cavalry. In all Chinese history, this was the greatest invasion force ever assembled. We were helpless against such an overwhelming force, Anjin-san. Again they began to land at Hakata Bay in Kyushu but before they could deploy all their armies a Great Wind, a <i>tai-fun</i>, came out of the south and destroyed the fleet and all it contained. Those left ashore were quickly killed. It was a <i>kamikaze</i>, a Divine Wind, Anjin-san,” she said with complete belief, “a <i>kamikaze</i> sent by the gods to protect this Land of the Gods from the foreign invader. The Mongols never came back and after eighty years or so their dynasty, the Chin, was thrown out of China,” Mariko added with great satisfaction. “The gods protected us against them. The gods will always protect us against invasion. After all, this is <i>their</i> land, <i>neh</i>?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne thought about the huge numbers of ships and men in the invasion; it made the Spanish Armada against England seem insignificant. “We were helped by a storm too, senhora,” he said with equal seriousness. “Many believe it was also sent by God—certainly it was a miracle—and who knows, perhaps it was.” He glanced at the brazier as a coal spluttered and flames danced. Then he said, “The Mongols nearly engulfed us in Europe, too.” He told her how the hordes of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan’s grandfather, had come almost to the gates of Vienna before his onslaught was stopped and then turned back, mountains of skulls in his wake. “People in those days believed Genghis Khan and his soldiers were sent by God to punish the world for its sins.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord Toranaga says he was just a barbarian who was immensely good at war.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes. Even so, in England we bless our luck we’re an island. We thank God for that and the Channel. And our navy. With China so close and so powerful—and with you and China at war—I’m surprised you don’t have a big navy. Aren’t you afraid of another attack?” Mariko did not answer but translated for Toranaga what had been said. When she had finished, Toranaga spoke to Yabu, who nodded and answered, equally serious. The two men conversed for a while. Mariko answered another question from Toranaga, then spoke to Blackthorne once more.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“To control your seas, Anjin-san, how many ships do you need?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I don’t know exactly, but now the Queen’s got perhaps a hundred and fifty ships-of-the-line. Those are ships built only for war.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master asks how many ships a year does your queen build?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Twenty to thirty warships, the best and fleetest in the world. But the ships are usually built by private groups of merchants and then sold to the Crown.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“For a profit?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackthorne remembered samurai opinion of profit and money. “The Queen generously gives more than the actual cost to encourage research and new styles of building. Without royal favor this would hardly be possible. For example, <i>Erasmus</i>, my ship, is a new class, an English design built under license in Holland.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Could you build such a ship here?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes. If I had carpenters, interpreters, and all the materials and time. First I’d have to build a smaller vessel. I’ve never built one entirely by myself before so I’d have to experiment . . . Of course,” he added, attempting to contain his excitement as the idea developed, “of course, if Lord Toranaga wanted a ship, or ships, perhaps a trade could be arranged. Perhaps he could order a number of warships to be built in England. We could sail them out here for him—rigged as he’d want and armed as he’d want.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mariko translated. Toranaga’s interest heightened. So did Yabu’s. “He asks, can our sailors be trained to sail such ships?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Certainly, given time. We could arrange for the sailing masters—or one of them—to stay in your waters for a year. Then he could set up a training program for you. In a few years you’d have your own navy. A modern navy. Second to none.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mariko spoke for a time. Toranaga questioned her again searchingly and so did Yabu.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yabu-san asks, second to none?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes. Better than anything the Spaniards would have. Or the Portuguese.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">A silence gathered. Toranaga was evidently swept by the idea though he tried to hide it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master asks, are you sure this could be arranged?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“How long would it take?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Two years for me to sail home. Two years to build a ship or ships. Two to sail back. Half the cost would have to be paid in advance, the remainder on delivery.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Toranaga thoughtfully leaned forward and put some more aromatic wood on the brazier. They all watched him and waited. Then he talked with Yabu at length. Mariko did not translate what was being said and Blackthorne knew better than to ask, as much as he would dearly have liked to be party to the conversation. He studied them all, even the girl Fujiko, who also listened attentively, but he could gather nothing from any of them. He knew this was a brilliant idea that could bring immense profit and guarantee his safe passage back to England.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Anjin-san, how many ships could you sail out?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“A flotilla of five ships at a time would be best. You could expect to lose at least one ship through storm, tempest, or Spanish-Portuguese interference—I’m sure they’d try very hard to prevent your having warships. In ten years Lord Toranaga could have a navy of fifteen to twenty ships.” He let her translate that, then he continued, slowly. “The first flotilla could bring you master carpenters, shipwrights, gunners, seamen, and masters. In ten to fifteen years, England could supply Lord Toranaga with thirty modern warships, more than enough to dominate your home waters. And, by that time, if you wanted, you could possibly be building your own replacements here. We’ll—” He was going to say “sell” but changed the word. “My Queen would be honored to help you form your own navy, and yes, if you wish, we’ll train it and provision it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Oh yes, he thought exultantly, as the final embellishment to the plan dropped into place, and we’ll officer it and provide the Admiral and the Queen’ll offer you a binding alliance—good for you and good for us—which will be part of the trade, and then together, friend Toranaga, we will harry the Spaniard and Portuguese dog out of these seas and own them forever. This could be the greatest single trading pact any nation has ever made, he thought gleefully. And with an Anglo-Japanese fleet clearing these seas, we English will dominate the Japan-China silk trade. Then it’ll be millions every year!</p>
      <p class="subsq">If I can pull this off I’ll turn the course of history. I’ll have riches and honors beyond my dream. I’ll become an ancestor. And to become an ancestor is just about the best thing a man can try to do, even though he fails in the trying.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master says, it’s a pity you don’t speak our language.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, but I’m sure you’re interpreting perfectly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“He says that not as a criticism of me, Anjin-san, but as an observation. It’s true. It would be much better for my Lord to talk direct, as I can talk to you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Do you have any dictionaries, Mariko-san? And grammars—Portuguese-Japanese or Latin-Japanese grammars? If Lord Toranaga could help me with books and teachers I’d try to learn your tongue.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We have no such books.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“But the Jesuits have. You said so yourself.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ah!” She spoke to Toranaga, and Blackthorne saw both Yabu’s and Toranaga’s eyes light up, and smiles spread over their faces.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My Master says you will be helped, Anjin-san.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">At Toranaga’s orders Fujiko gave Blackthorne and Yabu more saké. Toranaga drank only cha, as did Mariko. Unable to contain himself Blackthorne said, “What does he say to my suggestion? What’s his answer?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Anjin-san, it would be better to be patient. He will answer in his own time.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Please ask him now.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Reluctantly Mariko turned to Toranaga. “Please excuse me, Sire, but the Anjin-san asks with great deference, what do you think of his plan? He very humbly and most politely requests an answer.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“He’ll have my answer in good time.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mariko said to Blackthorne, “My Master says he will consider your plan and think carefully about what you have said. He asks you to be patient.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“<i>Domo</i>, Toranaga-sama.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m going to bed now. We’ll leave at dawn.” Toranaga got up. Everyone followed him below, except Blackthorne. Blackthorne was left with the night.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">At first promise of dawn Toranaga released four of the carrier pigeons that had been sent to the ship with the main baggage when the ship was being prepared. The birds circled twice, then broke off, two homing for Osaka, two for Yedo. The cipher message to Kiritsubo was an order to be passed on to Hiro-matsu that they should all attempt to leave peacefully at once. Should they be prevented, they were to lock themselves in. The moment the door was forced they were to set fire to that part of the castle and to commit seppuku.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The cipher to his son Sudara, in Yedo, told that he had escaped, was safe, and ordered him to continue secret preparations for war.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Get to sea, Captain.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, Lord.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">By noon they had crossed the bight between Totomi and Izu provinces and were off Cape Ito, the southernmost point of the Izu peninsula. The wind was fair, the swell modest, and the single mainsail helped their passage.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Then, close by shore in a deep channel between the mainland and some small rock islands, when they had turned north, there was an ominous rumbling ashore.</p>
      <p class="subsq">All oars ceased.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What in the name of Christ . . .” Blackthorne’s eyes were riveted shoreward.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Suddenly a huge fissure snaked up the cliffs and a million tons of rock avalanched into the sea. The waters seemed to boil for a moment. A small wave came out to the galley, then passed by. The avalanche ceased. Again the rumbling, deeper now and more growling, but farther off. Rocks dribbled from the cliffs. Everyone listened intently and waited, watching the cliff face. Sounds of gulls, of surf and wind. Then Toranaga motioned to the drum master, who picked up the beat once more. The oars began. Life on the ship became normal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What was that?” Blackthorne said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Just an earthquake.” Mariko was perplexed. “You don’t have earthquakes?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. Never. I’ve never seen one before.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, we have them frequently, Anjin-san. That was nothing, just a small one. The main shock center would be somewhere else, even out to sea. Or perhaps this one was just a little one here, all by itself. You were lucky to witness a small one.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It was as though the whole earth was shaking. I could have sworn I saw . . . I’ve heard about tremors. In the Holy Land and the Ottomans, they have them sometimes. Jesus!” He exhaled, his heart still thumping roughly. “I could have sworn I saw that whole cliff shake.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, it did, Anjin-san. When you’re on land, it’s the most terrible feeling in the whole world. There’s no warning, Anjin-san. The tremors come in waves, sometimes sideways, sometimes up and down, sometimes three or four shakes quickly. Sometimes a small one followed by a greater one a day later. There’s no pattern. The worst that I was in was at night, six years ago near Osaka, the third day of the Month of the Falling Leaves. Our house collapsed on us, Anjin-san. We weren’t hurt, my son and I. We dug ourselves out. The shocks went on for a week or more, some bad, some very bad. The Taikō’s great new castle at Fujimi was totally destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people were lost in that earthquake and in the fires that followed. That’s the greatest danger, Anjin-san—the fires that always follow. Our towns and cities and villages die so easily. Sometimes there is a bad earthquake far out to sea and legend has it that this causes the birth of the Great Waves. They are ten or twenty feet high. There is never a warning and they have no season. A Great Wave just comes out of the sea to our shores and sweeps inland. Cities can vanish. Yedo was half destroyed some years ago by such a wave.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“This is normal for you? Every year?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, yes. Every year in this Land of the Gods we have earth tremors. And fires and flood and Great Waves, and the monster storms—the tai-funs. Nature is very strong with us.” Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes. “Perhaps that is why we love life so much, Anjin-san. You see, we have to. Death is part of our air and sea and earth. You should know, Anjin-san, in this Land of Tears, death is our heritage.”</p>
