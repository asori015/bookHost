<p class="space-break"><em>Such killing grounds.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>And yet so strange. Word spreads until All-of-We know that here, here is something. As we generate and spend our energies new patterns emerge, a dizziness and madness of chemical gradients that lead Some-of-We to yearn towards this newness.</em></p>

<p class="space-break"><em>Some-of-We vanish, never to be heard from. But we are We and there is always More-of-We to learn from those that went before. Many-of-We are intrigued as to the possibilities of these new shapes and spaces.</em></p>
