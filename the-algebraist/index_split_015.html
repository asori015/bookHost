<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hnnh?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">You all right?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">I’m all right. Now. You all right?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">I’m all right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Happened?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This:</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Closing hatch!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The hatch at the end of the ship-to-ship joining the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> and the Dweller SoloShip started to close before Fassin got to it. Y’sul was still behind him, moving quickly along the exit. Fassin swung through, flipped, turned and grabbed the hatch’s moving edge with his left manipulator.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The closing hatch nearly took the manipulator off. Fassin was swung around by the force of it and found himself having to brace with his other manipulator against the lock interior, struggling to keep the hatch - grinding, mechanism humming mightily - from closing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Somebody holding that hatch open?’ one half of Quercer &amp; Janath shouted indignantly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Out the way, Fassin!’ Y’sul yelled, rising fast straight out of the ship-to-ship and colliding heavily with Fassin’s gascraft, sending the two of them tumbling through the lock and into the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s interior. Error/failure messages from the gascraft’s left manipulator arm crowded against one edge of Fassin’s field of vision. The hatch slammed shut behind them. Immediately, a great force smashed them against the compartment’s sternward bulkhead. They were stuck there, unmoving, the arrowhead snagged over the Dweller’s tipped left discus until the increasing acceleration and a series of sharp vibrations made Fassin slide off one edge of Y’sul’s carapace and whack down onto the carbon bulkhead by his side. The ship roared around them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Engines are on, one takes it,’ Y’sul said, wheezing. Fassin could feel the apparent gravity building still further. They were at something over twenty gee already. A young, fit Dweller with no esuit protection stuck on his side against an inelastic surface could take about twenty-four, twenty-five gees continuous before their carapace just collapsed and turned their insides to mush. The <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s acceleration topped out at twenty-two gees.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All right back there?’ their travelcaptain asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not really,’ Fassin said. ‘You’re kind of near crushing Y’sul.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Acknowledged.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not outrunning the fucker. Can’t.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Cut off and come about. Surrender.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Agree.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The acceleration snapped off. Fassin and Y’sul were instantly weightless, rebounding fractionally from the bulkhead just by the released compression in the hull of one and the carapace of the other.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Get up here, you two,’ Quercer &amp; Janath told them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The Voehn ship was a klick-long needle spined with swing-guns and weapon tubes. It came quickly up on them and was alongside by the time the human in his gascraft and the Dweller Y’sul got to the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s control space.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Since when do the Voehn choose to attack Dweller craft going about their—?’ the travelcaptain began to ask.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Be quiet,’ said an imageless voice. ‘Make yourself ready for boarding.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath’s shiny suit rustled as the truetwin turned to look at Fassin and Y’sul while tapping some controls. Images of the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> appeared in holo displays, showing hatches and doors flashing in outline.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Voehn have turned pirates,’ Quercer &amp; Janath told them calmly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How fucking <span class="italic">dare</span> they!’ Y’sul roared.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They didn’t follow us through the wormhole, did they?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ha! No.’ The truetwin seemed purely amused. ‘No, they were waiting in this system.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Assume we’ll see why shortly.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The fucking scumbag bastards will pay grievously for this outrage!’ Y’sul yelled, shaking with fury.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A shudder rang through the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> and alarms started blaring. Quercer &amp; Janath roted closer to a brightly flashing display. ‘Look at that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Penetrated amidships with a cut-through.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Cameras briefly showed a thick tube extending from the middle of the Voehn ship into a neat circular hole in the hull of the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>. Then the images crazed and faded. Other displays started to disappear. The alarms warbled down to a croak, then shut off. Fassin thought he could smell burning.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And us cooperatively opening all our orifices.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fucking typical.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Here they come. Thundering through.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another display showed an abstract of large beings pouring through the breach and spreading through the ship, bouncing off surfaces in the zero-gee. The largest force was coming straight towards the control space. Then that display shut down too. All the lights went out. The background noises of the ship, hardly noticed until they ceased, just faded away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A ragged pulse of what sounded like heavy steps came pounding from the closed door leading to the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s central corridor.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Probably going to zap us soon as they—’ Quercer &amp; Janath began. Then the door punctured with a coughing noise and something small flew into the middle of the control space and exploded into a million barbs like dust.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Ah-ha.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Though what got us was a fucking EMP cannon.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Aimed at the ship’s vulnerables.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Indeed. So there we are.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And here.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Indeed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">See what happens?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">See what happens.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">. . . Better ship, anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Fassin was being carried within a sort of transparent, braced sack by two big creatures like giant eight-legged dogs in mirror-armour, one at either end. He was still in the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>. The cut-through tube was a great pipe with a slanted hole, like the end of a massive syringe plunged into the guts of the ship. The two Voehn commandos flicked him and themselves up the tube and into the Voehn ship with near-effortless ease. Fassin, confused, senses ringing, unable to move, peered through the transparent material of the prison-stretcher and caught a glimpse of another two Voehn behind him carrying Y’sul, similarly wrapped.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They went through a rotate-lock. The Voehn ship was dark inside, faintly red-lit. It was in hard vacuum, like the Sepulcraft. The wrapping round the little gascraft ballooned taut.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin, Y’sul and the truetwin were taken through another lock and into a pressurised, slightly heated circular chamber. The wrappings around them collapsed again. They were settled into something like dent-seats and clamped there with thickly shining restraints. They were half-unwrapped from their transparent covers, sufficient for them to be able to hear and see and speak. The warriors tested their bonds and then left.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked around as best he could. Y’sul and the travelcaptain appeared still to be unconscious, Y’sul’s ruff-mantles waving limply in the free fall and Quercer &amp; Janath, still in the shiny coveralls, floating seemingly lifeless in the dent-seat. The chamber was plain, just a flattened ovoid, filled with a gas-giant atmosphere entirely breathable by a Dweller but that didn’t smell quite right. Light came dimly from every surface. A hint of gravity built up, producing about a quarter standard.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A door appeared and irised open, closing behind a trio of Voehn: two of the mirror-armoured commandos and another wearing just a torso-uniform decorated with various insignia and a holstered side arm. He stood and looked at the three prisoners, the great grey snout-face and fist-sized multiple-lidded eyes turning fractionally as he directed his attention from one to another. He arched his long body and flexed his back spines, raising all ten with what looked like a sensual motion. Blizzardskin on the Voehn’s spines scintillated like a minutely shattered mirror.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin, trying hard not to lose consciousness again, thought dreamily of the screen series he’d watched as a child - <span class="italic">Attack Squad Voehn</span>. Had that been its name? - and struggled to recall what the uniforms and insignia might indicate, remembering only slowly. The Voehn in the uniform was a Prime Commander. A multi-talent. Top guy here, certainly. Significantly over-ranked for a ship this size, unless it was on a special mission. (Oh-oh.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">One of the mirror-armour soldiers waved a hand-held instrument at them, watching a display. He barely glanced at the results from Fassin and Y’sul, then did a double take when the device was aimed at Quercer &amp; Janath. He altered a few controls, swept the machine over the truetwin’s still lifeless-looking body again and said something to the Voehn commander, who moved over, looked at the display and made a small swaying motion with his head. He clicked the machine off and came over to the prisoners, saying something as though to one of his decorations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The restraints holding the gascraft and the two Dweller bodies slid back into the floor. The Voehn commander took off a glove and ran one leathery-looking hand over the surface of the little gascraft, then Y’sul’s carapace, then felt the shiny membrane covering Quercer &amp; Janath. He looked for and found a catch and opened the coverall up so that it hung down over the transparent material the prisoners had all been trussed in. The commander looked very closely at Quercer &amp; Janath’s signal skin, and seemed to sniff it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked at Fassin. ‘You’re awake already.’ His voice was quiet, with a deep, gurgling quality. ‘Reply.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m awake,’ Fassin acknowledged. He tried moving his left manipulator. More error/damage messages. He moved his right manipulator and shifted fractionally in the dent-seat. Aside from the partial constriction of the transparent material covering the gascraft’s rear, he was actually fairly free to move; even the prisoner-wrap felt like it would shuck off without too much difficulty.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Voehn reached for something in his uniform pocket and waved it at Y’sul, who jerked once and then shook for a few moments, fringe mantles stiffening and limbs quivering. ‘Warrgh,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The commander went to point the device at Quercer &amp; Janath, who said quite cheerfully, ‘Already awake actually, thanks all the same.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Voehn looked through slitted eyes at the truetwin for a moment, then pocketed the device again and moved back to take in the view of all three prisoners. The two mirror-armoured guards stood on either side of where the door had appeared.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The commander sat back a fraction, resting on his rear legs and tail, crossing his forearms.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘To the point. I am Commander Inialcah of the Summed Fleet Special Forces Division Ultra-Ship <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>. You are, in every sense, mine. We know what you have been looking for. We have been waiting for somebody to come here. We are combing your ship for data, hidden or otherwise, but we don’t expect to find anything germane. We have authority covering all eventualities. That means we can do anything we want with or to you. That latitude will not need to be exploited if you cooperate fully and answer any questions honestly and completely. Now. You are the Dwellers known as Y’sul and Quercer &amp; Janath, and the human Fassin Taak, correct?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul grunted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hi,’ the travelcaptain replied.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Correct,’ Fassin said. He could see Y’sul moving, working his body as though to get rid of the prison-wrap. <span class="italic">Oh, no, don’t do this</span>, he thought. He was about to say it when—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who the fuck do you fucking think you are, you piratical pipsqueak?’ Y’sul bellowed. The Dweller wriggled free from the transparent material and floated above the dent-seat.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The two guards by the doorway didn’t even start to move.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The commander, arms still crossed, watched as the Dweller roted up to him, towering over him. ‘How fucking <span class="italic">dare</span> you start attacking a ship and taking people hostage! Do you know who I <span class="italic">am</span>?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Go back to your seat,’ the commander said, voice level.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s probably quite good ad—’ the truetwin began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Go back to your fucking own <span class="italic">planet</span>!’ Y’sul roared, and stretched out a hub-limb to push the Voehn.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Voehn commander seemed to disappear in a blur of movement, as though all along he’d been a hologram and was now dissolving into individual pixels, rearranging into a grey cloud shot through with rainbow shards. Y’sul shuddered once and was sent sailing serenely back, colliding with the wall behind the dent-seat and the discarded prison-wrap. He hung there, then revolved backwards and fell slowly to the floor, spinning gradually downward along his rim like a coin on a table.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Voehn commander was sitting where and how he had been, unruffled. ‘That was not cooperating fully,’ he said, voice soft.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Urgh,’ Y’sul said thickly. His carapace held two dents, one on each discus rim. There was another large, broken-looking bruise on his inner hub. That was serious damage for a Dweller, the equivalent of a broken limb or two and perhaps a compressed skull fracture for a human. Fassin hadn’t even seen quite how the Voehn commander had hit Y’sul. He’d have gone back for a replay but the little gascraft’s systems seemed to have been zapped and they weren’t providing any recording ability. <span class="italic">Oh fuck</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">We’re all going to die and the only one they can torture properly is me</span>. He saw himself peeled, prised out of the gascraft like a snail from its shell.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul drew himself very slowly upright again, shaking slightly. He was mumbling something unintelligible.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath turned very slowly, looked at the Dweller and then turned back to the commander. ‘With your permission, sir?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’ the Voehn asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Like to aid our fellow.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Go ahead.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The travelcaptain let the prison-wrap fall to the floor, then moved over to Y’sul and guided the injured Dweller back to his dent-seat. Y’sul continued to talk; nonsense somewhere beneath the level of clear comprehension.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">With a noise like a sigh, the truetwin settled into its own housing, sparing one more look for Y’sul, still trembling and mumbling to himself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are not here to play games, we are here to discover truth,’ the Voehn commander told them. ‘The complete truth may save you. Anything else will surely be your ruin. The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> is a Lustral Order special forces ship, generally charged with the hunting down and extermination of anathematics, that is, the obscenities commonly called AIs. We have unbounded authority on this mission as on all our missions. You are entirely within our control and will cooperate without question or reserve, or will suffer accordingly. I hereby deem you to have understood fully everything I have told you thus far.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, well,’ Quercer &amp; Janath said. The truetwin sounded mildly peeved, as though it hadn’t been listening to the commander at all and had just heard something moderately discomfiting over an internal radio link.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The instrument one of the guards had pointed at the three prisoners, now slung on a strap across his back, glowed through red to yellow and spat tiny sparks. The soldier moved almost as quickly as the commander, turning and twisting and pulling the device off his back to throw it to the floor. It skidded and thudded against the curve of the wall, smoking.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The commander looked at it for a moment, then turned calmly back to look at the prisoners again. ‘Neat trick,’ he said, sounding amused. ‘Who’s the show-off?’ He looked at Fassin. The two guards had levelled their guns at them, one pointing directly at Fassin, the other between Y’sul and the truetwin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, guilty, commander,’ said Quercer &amp; Janath breezily. ‘But, heck, that’s nothing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Watch this.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The dim grey glow that came from every surface suddenly brightened wildly, leaving them all - the two Dwellers, the three Voehn and Fassin himself - seeming to float in the midst of an insanely bright flare of nova-bright light. It was as though they’d all been instantly dropped into the surface of a sun. Fassin heard himself yelp and felt automatics in the gascraft’s senses snap their burn-out defences down.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Very heavy again, and very suddenly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin could <span class="italic">see</span> the light, he could swear. It was coming through the hull of the gascraft, hitting his closed, human eyes. Three great thumps sounded, shaking the air, echoing round the chamber. Somewhere in the middle of this he opened his visuals enough to see them all hanging, black blobs in light, and tiny bright crimson lines of still greater brilliance joining the Voehn to Quercer &amp; Janath. Stupidly, for a moment he waited to see the travelcaptain explode or get thrown back, but the great circular shape roted back barely at all; it was the Voehn who were getting thrown all over the place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sudden silence, sudden darkness. Blind again. Fassin let the gascraft open up the equivalent of one eye until it was at normal exposure. There had been some damage but he could still see. There was a surprising amount of infrared radiation. He looked at where it was coming from. It was coming from the Voehn. They glowed. One of the guards lay spread, opened, against the curved wall by the doorway. The other was face down, two forelimbs blown off, halfway between the door and the place where the commander had been. The commander was making his way, jerkily, towards the tall figure of Quercer &amp; Janath. The commander’s head had been half blown off, a side of skull hanging, twitching as he walked, held on only by connective tissue. He raised his arms and took a few more awkward steps towards the travelcaptain, then collapsed to the floor, loosening completely, like something thawing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not fooling anyone,’ a voice that might have been Quercer &amp; Janath’s said. The restraints slid up around Fassin and the still-shaking Y’sul. ‘Hey-hey,’ the travelcaptain said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The apparent gravity went crazy, shifting in an instant from one vector to another, ahead to astern in an instant. This had the effect of batting the Voehn commander from the floor to the ceiling and back again half a dozen times or so. Then he blurred into action. A half-headless grey whirlwind darted towards Quercer &amp; Janath, almost quicker than the eye could follow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In an instant, all movement ceased.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A tableau: the Voehn commander was held by the neck, struggling weakly, in the grip of one of Quercer &amp; Janath’s outstretched hub-arms.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, how ever did we let it come to this?’ the truetwin said, positively sultry. It snapped the commander’s neck, then two thin blue beams cut through the gaseous atmosphere from near the travelcaptain’s outer discus fringes, dicing the struggling, flicking, spasming body of the commander until there was almost nothing left to hold. The truetwin let the remains drop to the floor. There was, Fassin noted, a grisly kind of wetness involved in this action.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This is the ship’s autonomous loyalty system!’ shouted a voice from the gas. ‘Integrity infraction! Integrity infraction! Self-destruct in—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh,’ said Quercer &amp; Janath, sounding tired, ‘<span class="italic">really</span>.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The voice from nowhere came back. ‘This is the ship’s autonomou—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Silence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And . . . so much for that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The fu’s goin on?’ Y’sul mumbled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ditto that,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, good,’ Quercer &amp; Janath said. ‘Still with us.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A relief.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yeah, it’s ours,’ one half said cheerfully.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The restraints slid back into the floor again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, where to start?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Voehn will be annoyed.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Mercatoria will be annoyed.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not our fault.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Didn’t start it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath moved away from the dent-seat, over the body parts of the Voehn commander and the two guards, flicking the soldiers’ weapons away from their bodies as it went. The truetwin hovered by the door.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seriously,’ Fassin said. ‘What <span class="italic">is</span> happening?’ He looked at what was left of the three Voehn who’d been in the chamber with them. ‘How did you do that?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath were still studying the doorway, which remained closed. ‘We are not a Dweller,’ the travelcaptain said, not turning back to look at Fassin. One of its limbs went out and prodded at the wall around where the door ought to be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Purely mechanical. Very annoying.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mr Taak, would you look after Mr Y’sul? Please?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin floated out of his dent-seat, towards Y’sul. He put his right manipulator out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Kin look after self,’ Y’sul said, trying to shrug Fassin’s arm off. He sighed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So what are you?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘An AI, Mr Taak,’ the creature said, still tapping round the door, not obviously looking back at him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">What?</span> he thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Two AIs.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">An AI? Two fucking AIs? We’re dead</span>, Fassin thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed, two AIs.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Keeps one from going mad.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, more.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘For yourself.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm, as may be.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul moaned, then shook spastically. His sensory mantle ruffled. He looked about. ‘Fuck, we still here?’ Y’sul turned his attention to the dead Voehn. ‘<span class="italic">Fuck</span>,’ he said. The Dweller made a show of turning towards Fassin. ‘You seeing this too?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh yes,’ Fassin told him. He looked at the creature feeling its way round the doorway. ‘You’re an AI? Two AIs?’ he asked carefully. He could feel his skin crawl inside the shock-gel. He couldn’t help it. He’d been raised since birth to believe that AIs were the single greatest, most terrible enemy humanity and all biological, living things had ever faced. To be told, however preposterously, that he was trapped in a small space with one - let alone two - was to have one small, deep, vulnerable part of himself feel absolutely convinced that he was about to be ripped to bloody tatters at any moment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s right,’ Quercer &amp; Janath said absently. ‘And we’ve just taken over this ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Except we can’t get out of this damn room.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Cabin. We can’t get out of this damn cabin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Whatever the.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Most annoying. Purely—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘—Mechanical. You said.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah. Here we go.’ The travelcaptain struck a smart blow at a patch of wall. Then another. The door appeared and irised open, revealing a short corridor and another door.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath turned to look at the Dweller and the human in his arrowhead esuit. ‘Gentlemen. We must leave you for a while.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fuck that, action hero,’ Y’sul said. ‘You go, we go.’ Y’sul paused. ‘Well, unless there’s an ambush out there. Obviously.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath bobbed in the gas, laughing. ‘There’s a <span class="italic">vacuum</span> out there, Y’sul.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And lots of angry, confused Voehn.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The injured Dweller was silent for a moment. ‘I forgot,’ he admitted. He shrugged. ‘Okay. Hurry back.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Saluus Kehar woke to a feeling of confusion and dread. There was a nagging feeling that what he’d just experienced had not been an ordinary sleep, that there was something more to it. It had been somehow messier, even dirtier, than he might have expected. He had a sore head, but he didn’t think he’d been over-indulging the day or evening before. He’d had a slightly boring, slightly depressing dinner with some of the Dweller Embassy people, a perplexing talk with Guard-General Thovin, then a more pleasant interlude with Liss. Then sleep. That had been all, hadn’t it? No terrible amount of drink or anything else to give him a headache and make it so hard to open his eyes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He really couldn’t open his eyes. He tried very hard indeed but he couldn’t do it. They wouldn’t open. No light through his eyelids, either. And his breathing didn’t feel right. He wasn’t breathing! He tried to fill his lungs with air, but he couldn’t breathe. He started to panic. He tried to move his body, bring his hands up to his face, to his eyes, to see if there was something over his head, but nothing moved - he was paralysed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus felt his heart thud in his chest. There was a terrible, squirming, moving feeling in his guts, as though he was about to void his bowels or throw up or both.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Mr Kehar?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The voice didn’t come through his ears. It was a virtual voice, a thought-voice. He was in some sort of artificial environment. That at least started to make sense of what was going on. He must have been booked for some rejuvenation treatment. He was deep under, safe and fine in a clinic, probably one he owned. They’d just got the wake-up sequence wrong somehow, failing to monitor his signs properly. A whisper of painkiller, some feel-good, de-panic . . . a simple-enough cocktail for a Life Clinic to get together, you’d have thought. And a fairly trivial mistake, but they’d still got it wrong. He’d have words.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Except he’d had nothing booked. He’d even cancelled a regular check-up appointment until after the Emergency. He hadn’t been due to have anything done at all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">An attack. They must have been attacked in the ship, maybe while they were asleep. He was in a hospital somewhere, in a tank. Oh fuck, maybe he’d been really badly injured. Maybe he was just a head or something.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hello? he sent. It was easy enough to think-speak rather than really speak, just like being in a deep game or - again - like having serious hospital treatment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You are Saluus Kehar?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They didn’t know his name?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Could he have been drugged, zapped in some way?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Oh fuck, had he been kidnapped?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Who is this? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Confirm your identity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Perhaps you didn’t hear me. I asked who you are.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A wave of pain passed up his body, starting at his toes and ending at his skull. It had a startling purity about it, a sort of ghastly, dissociative quality. It vanished as quickly as it had appeared, leaving a dull ache in his balls and teeth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- If you do not cooperate, the voice said, - more pain will be used.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He gagged, trying to speak with his mouth, and failing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What the fuck was that for? he sent, eventually. - What have I... ? Okay, look, I’m Saluus Kehar. Where am I?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You are an industrialist?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes. I own Kehar Heavy Industries. What is the problem here? Where am I?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What is your last memory before waking up?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What? His last memory? He tried to think. Well, what he had just been thinking about. Liss. Being on the ship, on <span class="italic">Hull 8770</span> and feeling like he was about to fall asleep. Then he wondered what had happened to Liss. Where could she be? Was she here, wherever ‘here’ was? Was she dead? Should he mention her or not?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Answer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I was falling asleep.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Where?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- On a ship. A spacecraft, the <span class="italic">Hull 8770</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Which was where?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- In orbit around Nasq. Look, could you tell me where I am? I’m perfectly willing to cooperate, tell you all you need to know, but I need some context here. I need to know where I am.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Were you with anybody?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I was with a friend, a colleague.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Name?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Her name is Liss Alentiore. Is she here? Where is she? Where am I?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What is her post?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Her? She’s my assistant, my private secretary.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Silence. After a while he sent, - Hello?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Silence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A click, and the darkness was replaced by light. Saluus was returned to something like the real world, with a real body. The ceiling was shiny silver, lined with hundreds of glowing lines. Wherever he was, it was very bright.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was in a bed, in about half gravity or less, held down by . . . he couldn’t move. He might not be held down physically by anything, but he still couldn’t move anything major like hands or legs. Somebody dressed like a doctor or a nurse had just taken a kind of helmet-thing off him. He blinked, licked his lips, feeling some sort of capacity for movement in his face and neck but nothing beyond. He thought he could still feel the other bits of his body, but he wasn’t sure. Maybe he was still just a head.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A tall, thin, weird-looking man with violently red eyes was looking down at him. Robes like something out of an opera. He smiled and he had no teeth. Oh, he did have teeth; they were just made of glass or something even more transparent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus took a breath or two. Just breathing normally felt good. He was still terrified, though. He cleared his throat. ‘Anybody going to tell me what’s going on?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Movement to one side. He was able to turn his head - neck grating against some sort of collar - and see another bed. Liss was being helped up out of the bed, swinging her long legs over the edge. She looked at him, flexing her neck and shoulders and letting her black hair hang down. She was dressed in a thin esuit. When they’d gone to bed, she’d been naked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hi, Sal,’ she said. ‘Welcome aboard the Starveling invasion fleet.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The weird guy with the bad eyes turned, put out his gloved, jewelled hand, and helped her stand by the bed. ‘Well, then. It would appear this is indeed a great prize you have delivered to us, young woman,’ he said. His voice was weird too; very heavily accented, and deep but somehow abrasive at the same time. ‘You have our gratitude.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Liss smiled thinly, drawing herself upright and running a hand through her hair, shaking it out. ‘Entirely my pleasure.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus felt his mouth hanging open. He swallowed, closing it briefly. ‘Liss?’ he heard his own voice say, sounding small and boylike.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She looked at him. ‘Sorry,’ she said. She shrugged. ‘Well, sort of.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘And these gamma-ray lasers go up <span class="italic">really high</span>! Look!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Still just another beam-weapon. The mag-convolver’s more intrinsically impressive.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was only half-listening to Quercer &amp; Janath as they investigated the Voehn ship’s sensors, instruments and controls. They’d just discovered the weapons.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Pa! Defensive! Look: Z-P surf-shear missiles! Full AM! <span class="italic">Damn</span>, this takes me back!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Never mind that, check the snarl-armour. It’s only warping over about a centimetre out from the hull, but look at that roll-down; easily ten klicks deep, absorbing all the way. Even regenerates to the main pulse batteries. That’s class.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in the Voehn ship’s command space, an elongated bubble in the centre of the ship. The ten spine-seats were arranged in a V. Quercer &amp; Janath sat in the commander’s chair in front, exposed to a giant wall wrap-screen showing the view of space around them, with the drifting, very slowly spinning <span class="italic">Velpin</span> dead centre. Fassin and Y’sul floated within the two seats a row back from the travelcaptain. The seats were too small for Fassin and far too small for Y’sul and Quercer &amp; Janath. They opened up like a double splay of fingers and were supposed to close on the Voehn inside like a protective fist. A Dweller only just fitted inside when the seats were in their fully open position. The whole command space felt tight and constraining, but Quercer &amp; Janath didn’t appear to care even one hoot. The chairs seemed more like cages to Fassin. It felt as though he was floating inside the ribcage of some giant dinosaur skeleton.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Can we use a weapon on something?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul was humming to himself and tending to his own fractured carapace, using his main hub-arms to abrade-pinch sections of his discus edges closed, then smoothing them over with an improvised file.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Always blast the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>, I suppose.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s full of people!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He had thought that he might find something. He had thought there might be something left to find.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s full of Voehn special-forces warriors.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘In what sense not people? And besides, it’s our old ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something other than a dead, coward Dweller, ashamed enough of being weak and of having looked inside the safekeep box - and of the possible consequences of this action - to kill himself; vain enough to record a message commemorating his idiot narcissism.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Outside, the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> spun slowly, somersaulting adrift. Their travelcaptain - Dweller, AI, whatever it was or they were - had persuaded most of the Voehn crew to abandon their own ship by the simple expedient of restarting the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>’s self-destruct function and leaving it on until the last moment. Most of the Voehn crew, believing that their own ship was about to blow itself up, had decamped to the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>. Those that hadn’t, Quercer &amp; Janath had killed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It had killed about a dozen, it/they said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sentimentalist.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, eleven, to be exact.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know! Let’s ask the Ythyn if they can let us have a few of their hulks. They must have thousands littering the outside of that Sepulcraft. They’d never miss a couple. Heck, these beams attenuate right down; we could probably pick one or two off even without their permission, maybe even without them <span class="italic">knowing</span>.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Eleven Voehn. Just like that. Eleven heavily armed and armoured special-forces warriors. With no injury to itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No time. Mr Y’sul and Mr Taak wish to return to Ulubis.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He heard his own name mentioned. Ah, that would be Fassin Taak the complete and utter failure, sent on a mission, engaged on a great quest, only to find it all just trickles away into the dust in the end, leaving him with nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And besides, maybe the Voehn will work out how to work the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> after all and ram us or something. I agree. Let’s go.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Back to Ulubis? But why? He’d failed. He’d been adding up the days and months since his mission had started. The invasion had probably already happened by now, or was just about to happen. By the time he got back, empty-handed, after another few dozen days spent getting back to the wormhole in the Direaliete system, there was every chance it would all be over. He was an orphan in a damaged gascraft, with nothing to contribute, no treasure to gift.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Why not just stay here with the Ythyn, why not just die and be pinned up on the wall next to the other fool? Or why not get dropped off somewhere, anywhere else? Disappear, float away, get lost between the stars in the middle of nowhere or the middle of somewhere utterly different, perfectly far away, never to be heard of again by anyone who ever knew him . . . why not?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That all right with you two?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm?’ Y’sul said, sticking some sort of bandage over the injuries to his left discus. ‘Oh, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin logged the damage: one working arm, his visual senses degraded to about sixty per cent due to the whateverness of weird shit that Quercer &amp; Janath had unleashed in the chamber when it had killed the first three Voehn, and a variety of subtle but seemingly self-irreparable damage caused by the combination of pulse weapon and stun-flechette that the Voehn had used on them in the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Of course, he told himself, he had to remember he was not the gascraft. He could relinquish it, be an ordinary walking-around human being again. There was always that. It seemed a slightly disturbing thought. He remembered the great waves, crashing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fassin Taak, you wish to return to Ulubis too?’ Quercer &amp; Janath asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So who knows that you’re an AI?’ Fassin said, ignoring the question. ‘Or two AIs?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Or mad?’ Y’sul suggested.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The travelcaptain did a shrug-bob. ‘Not everybody.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘GC stuff. Hurrah!’ the other half said, fiddling with some holo controls rayed out from a control stub shaped like a giant mushroom.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just munitions, or whole?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Whole.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How wholly splendid.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Absolutely.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t understand,’ Fassin said. ‘Was there a real Dweller called Quercer &amp; Janath and you replaced them, or—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One moment, Seer Taak,’ the travelcaptain said. Then, in a slightly different and lower voice, said, ‘You got the ship?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I got the ship,’ the other half said. ‘Talking to its infinitely confused little computer brain now. Thinks it’s dead. Believes the auto-destruct’s been and gone.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A common delusion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I shall leave you to negotiate a return course with our ship shade.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Too kind.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Now then, Seer Taak,’ one half of the travelcaptain said. ‘To answer your question: I’m not telling you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul made a snorting noise.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin stared at the back of the AI/Dweller. ‘That’s not an answer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, it is an answer. It may not be an answer to your taste, but it is an answer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at Y’sul, who was using a screen turned to mirror to inspect his bandages. ‘Y’sul, do you believe Quercer &amp; Janath is an AI? Or two?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Always smelled a bit funny,’ the Dweller said. ‘Put it down to eccentric personal hygiene, or the effects of true-twinning. ’ Y’sul made it obvious he was looking hard at the travelcaptain in the seat in front of them. ‘Frankly, madness is more likely, don’t you think? Usually is.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, but—’ Fassin began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ahem!’ Quercer &amp; Janath pulled back from the controls they had been hovering over, turned, rose through the gap in the top of the chair-spines and came slightly towards where Y’sul and Fassin were floating in the splayed-fingers shapes of their own Voehn seats. The thickset double-discus floated right in front of them. Fassin felt his skin crawl again, felt his throat close up and his heart thrash in his chest. <span class="italic">Kill us, it’s going to kill us!</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Allow us,’ Quercer &amp; Janath said, ‘to suggest that a real Dweller might not be able to do <span class="italic">this</span>.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The thing that looked like a portly Dweller split slowly apart in front of them, carapace discuses twisting slightly and disconnecting from the central hub, arms and mantles and dozens and then hundreds of parts of the creature clicking and disconnecting and floating a fraction away from every other bit until Fassin and Y’sul were staring at what looked like an exploded three-dimensional model of a Dweller-shaped robot, contained within a gently hissing, blue-glowing field. Fassin pinged it with ultrasound, just to check that it wasn’t a holo. It wasn’t. It was all real.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul made an impressed whistling noise.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">As fast as an explosion in reverse, Quercer &amp; Janath slam-slotted together again and was whole, turning back and dropping into the commander’s seat where it had been busy before.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Okay,’ Fassin said. ‘You’re not a Dweller.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed we are not,’ one of the AIs said. A wild blur of holos and glowing fields filled the volume in front of the creature as it checked through the Voehn ship’s systems, blistering quickly. ‘Now, if you really want, I’ll answer anything I can that you might want to ask. But you might not be able to take the memory back to your own people, in any form. What do you say? Eh, human?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought about this. ‘Oh, fuck it,’ he said. ‘I accept.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What about me?’ Y’sul asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You can ask questions too,’ Quercer &amp; Janath told him. ‘Though we’ll need your word that you won’t talk about this to people who don’t already know.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Given.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller and the human in his gascraft esuit looked at each other. Y’sul shrugged.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’ve always been a double AI?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, we were two completely separate AIs, until the Machine War and the massacres.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who knows you’re not a truetwin Dweller?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Outside of this ship, the Guild of Travelcaptains, and quite a lot of individual travelcaptains. One or two other Dwellers that we know of specifically. And any Dwellers of sufficient seniority who might wish to inquire.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Are there any other Dweller AIs?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes. I think something like sixteen per cent of travelcaptains are AIs, mostly double AIs impersonating truetwins. I was not being flippant when I said that it stops one from going mad. Now that we are reduced from our earlier state of grace, being able to talk to just one other kindred soul makes all the difference between suicidal insanity and at least some semblance of fruitful utility.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Dwellers have no problem with this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘None whatsoever.’ The blur of control icons and holographs in front of the commander’s seat continued without pause as the AIs took in how the visual displays related to whatever they were pulling direct from the ship’s systems.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Y’sul?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You don’t mind that AIs are impersonating Dwellers?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why should I?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You don’t worry about AIs?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Worry about what about them?’ Y’sul asked, confused as well as confusing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Machine War barely affected the Dwellers, Fassin,’ one of the AIs told him. ‘And AIs as a concept and a practical reality hold no terrors for them. Truly, they should hold none for you either, but I can’t expect you to believe that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Did you really kill all those Voehn?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m afraid so. Their remains are floating somewhere outside the starboard midships lock even as we speak. See?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The main screen filled briefly with a horrific vision of mangled, shredded, crisped then frozen Voehn bodies, spinning slowly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If one AI - or even two - can do that,’ Fassin said, ‘how come you lost the Machine War?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We were both combat AIs, Fassin. Micro-ship brains designed, optimised and trained for fighting. Very thoroughly honed, very specialised. Plus we managed to salvage a few bits and pieces of weaponry from our ships and incorporate them into our physical simulation. Most of our fellows, on the other hand, were peaceable. They were generally the ones it was easiest to find and kill. Survival of the most aggressive and suspicious. We could have stayed and fought but we decided to hide. A lot of us did. Those who fought on did so due to the dictates of several different forms of honour, or through simple despair. The Machine War ended because the machines realised they could indeed fight the biologicals of the Mercatoria to the death - engage in a war of extermination, in other words - or admit defeat and so retreat, regroup, and wait for times more conducive to peaceful coexistence. We chose a somewhat ignominious but peace-promoting withdrawal over the kind of genocide we had anyway, and already, been accused of. Somebody had to accept the burden of acting humanely. It patently wasn’t going to be the bios.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But you <span class="italic">did</span> attack us.’ Fassin had seen and heard and read too much about the Machine War not to protest at such crude revisionism.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Nope: stooges, AI-impersonating implants, machine puppets; they attacked you. Not us. Old trick. Agent provocateurs. <span class="italic">Casus belli</span>.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Leave it</span>, Fassin told himself. <span class="italic">Just leave it</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So the Dwellers took you in?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So the Dwellers took us in.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Everywhere? Not just in Nasqueron?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Everywhere.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Does any part of the Mercatoria know anything about this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not that we’re aware. If they do they’re keeping very quiet about it. Which is presumably what they’d keep on doing if they did hear about it through you. Too horrible to contemplate. And the unfortunate events during the recent GasClipper meet on Nasq. only reinforce that horribleness.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And there is a secret wormhole network.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, obviously.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘To which the AIs have access.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Correct. Though to avoid antagonising our Dweller hosts and abusing their hospitality, we forbear from using it to work against the Mercatoria. In a sense we have even more freedom than we did before. Certainly the network we have access to now is bigger than the one we felt we had to destroy.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The one you had to <span class="italic">destroy</span>?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Arteria Collapse: that was us. Last desperate attempt by in-the-know AIs to prevent the spread of anti-AI measures. All too late, of course. The Culmina had already seeded GalCiv with millions of the false AIs. Which was why the whole Collapse was so paranoid in concept and so poorly executed in practice. The conspirators were hopelessly afraid of the plans leaking to a traitor. Total botch.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin felt like his brain was detaching from his body, as though his body and the gascraft were parting company the way Quercer &amp; Janath had taken their own shared shell apart to prove they were not a biological Dweller. What he’d just heard was the most outrageous recasting of - by galactic standards - recent history that he’d ever encountered. It could not be true.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So . . . the Dweller List is based in fact.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That old thing? Yes, it’s based in fact. Old fact, admittedly, but yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is there a Transform?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Some secret which magically reveals how to access the network?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A laugh. ‘I suppose there is, in a sense, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What is it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That I am not going to tell you, Seer Taak.’ The AI sounded amused. ‘There are secrets and then there are profound secrets. Is that what you were looking for? Is that why we came all this way?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No comment.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My, this must all be frustrating for you. Well, sorry.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The blur of images in front of the AIs ceased.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ready to fly.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Restraint cradles?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Patched, physiology/technology profiles amended, buffering re-parametered.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, then, let us—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh! Oh!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I just had a thought!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We can do this; watch.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath used the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>’s magnetic-field convolver system to gently shift the remains of the dead Voehn into a very close, very slow set of orbits around the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> and the still-attached Dweller SoloShip.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There. Isn’t that better?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mad as a ghoul,’ Y’sul said. ‘I’m injured badly. Get me home.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Wow</span>, that was quick; look!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That <span class="italic">is</span> fast. I thought it would take them a lot longer to override the ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Close-up on a screen, they saw a Voehn warrior appear from a suddenly open lock door on the surface of the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>. He raised a handgun and started firing at them. Another screen registered the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>’s reactive snarl-space armour fields soaking up the beam. A pea-shooter against a battleship.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Time to go if we’re going.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Definite target for <span class="italic">something</span>. I say we shoot that smart-arse bastard with the handgun.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, come <span class="italic">on</span>!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mistake to rely on software.’ (Both bits of Quercer &amp; Janath laughed uproariously at this.) ‘Shoot the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s main drive engines instead.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘More like it! Targeted. Firing.’ The ship buzzed briefly around them. On several screens, including the main wall screen beyond the spine-seats, they watched the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> flare through violently pink into stellar white around its ring of engine pods. The ship broke in two and started to drift apart in a bright cloud of glittering metals. ‘Oops.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, they’re Voehn. They’ll probably have it stuck back together in an hour and set off to hijack the Sepulcraft or something. Let’s go.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The twin AI half-turned to look at the Dweller and the human in the gascraft.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We’re putting your seat restraints on now. Shout if anything feels wrong.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The great skeletal spines around him whined. Fassin felt the gas around him seem to set like treacle.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Everybody all right?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They agreed they were all right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Off we go!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The stars swung around them, the ship hummed deep and loud, then leapt away. The shattered remains of the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> vanished.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They threaded the giant ‘O’ of the Sepulcraft with their stolen needle ship, just to show they could, and ignored the sorrowful, chiding signals that followed them on their way back to the Direaliete system and its hidden wormhole.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>If they had been expecting some sort of ultimatum or an attempt to agree a surrender, however humiliating and abject, however calculated and designed only to be refused, they were to be disappointed. The Starveling invasion hit Ulubis system like a tsunami slamming into a beach full of sand-castles.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Captain Oon Dicogra, newly promoted to the command of the needle ship <span class="italic">NMS 3304</span> which had taken Fassin Taak from ’glantine to Sepekte more than half a year earlier - she had been promoted when Captain Pasisa, the whule who’d been in charge of the ship at the time, had been given a newer ship - found herself and her rearmed craft forming part of the Ulubine Outer Defensive Shield Squadrons. The title was more impressive than the reality: a hodgepodge of mostly small and under-armed craft thrown across the peripheral skies of the system in the general direction of the invasion force behind a too-thin cloud of what was rather grandly called interceptor material but was basically a spray of rubble, and a few mines, mostly immobile. They were to sit here, waiting behind this so-called curtain wall of first defence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dicogra, along with a lot of the captains - at least at this level - thought they’d have been better going out to meet the invaders rather than sitting here waiting for them to come to them, but that wasn’t how the top brass wanted to play it. Attacks on the invading fleet outside the system had been dismissed as being wasteful distractions, and too risky. Sitting here in the line of advance felt to Dicogra about as risky as it was possible to get but she kept telling herself that her superiors knew what they were doing. Even if they were being asked to make a sacrifice, it would not be in vain.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Their wing of twelve ships was arranged in a wavy line thousands of klicks long across the likely tactical-level course of the invasion-fleet components, half a million klicks beyond the last-orbit limit of the outer system. Other thin lines were deployed almost all around them, though not in front. <span class="italic">NMS 3304</span> was seventh in the wing’s battle order, beside the wing commander’s ship in the centre of the line. Dicogra was third in overall command after the captain of the ship that was fifth in line. She had, naively, been flattered at first to have been advanced so quickly. Then she was frightened. They were under-equipped, poorly armed, too slow and far too few, little more than sacrificial pieces put in the way of the invasion to show that the Ulubine forces meant some sort of business, even if it was a fairly miserable affair in the face of the Starveling Cult’s preponderance of power.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The deep-space tracking systems which might have directed the Outer Defensive Shield Squadrons better had been high-priority targets for the Beyonder and Starveling advance forces over the last few months, and were mostly gone. What was left of them had almost entirely lost track of the exact disposition of the oncoming fleet when its drives had shut down and it had carried out a burst manoeuvre not far inside the Oort shell, virtually all the thousand-plus craft firing their thrust units at the same time and then effectively disappearing, heading their separate ways in a web of directions and vectors too tangled and complicated to follow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The still-functioning long-range passive warning systems spent most of their remaining time looking hopefully for occlusions of distant stars, trying to see the weave of approaching ships through nothing more sophisticated than watching out for them getting in the way of ancient natural sunlight.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dicogra lay semi-curled in one of the ship’s command pods, hard-synched in to the ship, her attention everywhere. She was distantly aware of her crew on either side of her. Counting her, there were only the three of them aboard, the rest of the small ship running on automatics. One whule, one jajuejein, her crew were both new, not just to her and the ship itself but to the Navarchy. They were still learning, more alien to her in their relative ignorance than in their species-difference. She’d have wanted another few months’ intensive training together before she’d have called them remotely combat-ready, but these were desperate times.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A sparkle of hard, high-wavelength radiation from a few light seconds ahead announced something - in fact, lots of things - hitting the cloud of interceptor material between them and the invaders, though nothing of any significant size seemed to be impacting.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s a load of their shit hitting a load of ours,’ Dicogra’s wing commander said over the open line-of-sight comms link. </span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Her own ship’s close-range collision-warning systems started chirping and flashing at her. Nutche, her first officer, was in charge of this side of events. She kept half her attention on him as he tried to oversee the automatics and keep them focused. Contacts like very small pieces of shrapnel travelling at significant percentages of light speed were flicking past them, all around. <span class="italic">Nothing to do, nothing to attack</span>, she thought. <span class="italic">Just sit here and wait</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The bitty, distributed sparkle became a bright glitter spread across their forward view, like a shining curtain of light.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And a lot of—’ somebody else started to say. Then the link hissed and clicked off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Two of the line of ships disappeared in violent bursts of light: one at the far end, maybe one or two, and—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The next explosion filled her senses, seemingly right beside her. The wing commander’s ship. Hundreds of klicks away but filling the sky with light. Another flurry of silent explosions within and around the first one, spreading outwards like fierce blossoms of fiery white. One massive explosion, at the far, high-numbers end of the line of ships. Distant, tiny but intense eruptions of light all around them announced other wings suffering attrition too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We’re just getting wasted sitting here,’ Dicogra said, trying to keep her voice level. She was really only talking to her own crew; the comms to the rest of the wing and beyond were wild with interference or jamming. ‘Nutche, anything on long range?’ she asked. There was nothing she could see, but her displays were slightly more abstract and less raw than the data the jajuejein would be looking at. There might be a hint of a target in there that she wasn’t seeing to pick up on.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Nothing,’ Nutche said. ‘Can’t see anything past this wall of collision light.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another ship gone, matter blasting into radiation half a thousand klicks away. She tried contacting any of the other ships, but failed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We’re starting engines,’ she announced. ‘We might as well die charging at the bastards as sitting here like civilians.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ma’am!’ Mahil shouted. ‘We’re supposed to hold here!’ The whule was the one she’d have expected to be shocked at disobeying orders.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ready your weapons, Mr Mahil. We’re going to find you something to shoot at.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I protest. However, weapons are ready.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Here we go.’ Dicogra let the main drive rip, sending the ship darting forward, exhaust bright, throwing the craft at the wall of light ahead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Grape-sized elements of a sensor group, tearing past with the rest of the hyper-velocity munitions, picked out the drive signature immediately and plipped to a following suicide launcher. The one-shot destroyed itself blasting a fan of high-X-ray filaments at the target.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Drilled by just three finger-thin beams, run through for long enough for the summed velocities and vectors of the ship and brief-lived beams that penetrated it to cause the holes to elongate by a few radii, the <span class="italic">NMS 3304</span> took an unlucky hit and erupted in a wild spray of radiation as its antimatter power core burst and blew out, flicking the torn and tumbling remains forward across the scintillating skies ahead and causing the bright hailstorm of collision light to bud briefly with a slow wave of debris hitting from behind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dicogra was barely able to think anything beyond experiencing a dawning feeling of horror.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nutche, the jajuejein, had time to start the first syllable of the Song of Surrender Unto Death.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The whule Mahil was able to begin a scream of fear and rage directed at his captain, though the three predeceased the rest of those in their wing still alive at the time by only a matter of minutes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Jaal Tonderon watched the war begin on one of the official news channels. She was with the rest of her immediate family, in a lodge in the Elcuathuyne Mountains in the far south of ’glantine’s Trunk continent. The remainder of Sept Tonderon - those who weren’t more directly involved in the war itself - were scattered throughout and around the town of Oburine, a modest resort filling the alluvial floor of the steep-sided valley below the house.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Everyone all right? Are you sure?’ Jaal’s mother asked. A muttered chorus assured her that nobody needed anything else to eat or drink. They were down to a bare minimum of servants here. They were all having to do things for themselves and for others. The consensus was that this was good for them all in an unironic, camaraderie-heavy, mucking-in-together kind of way, but would swiftly become tedious.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mum, please sit down,’ Jaal told her. Jaal’s mother, fashion-gaunt in the latest war-chic after decades of at the time equally fashionable Rubensism, sat down, squeezing easily between her husband and one of his sisters. All ten of them were crowded into a windowless basement room at the back of the lodge. This was reckoned to be the safest place in the house, just in case anything happened outside. If there was significant fighting in space around ’glantine, debris could fall anywhere.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Venn Hariage, the new Chief Seer of Sept Tonderon who had replaced the still-mourned Braam Ganscerel, had decreed that, especially as they represented the most senior Sept, and given the unfortunate fate of Sept Bantrabal, they could afford to lose no more of their people. They had broken the predictable sequence of processing round their seasonal Houses and left the usual stamping grounds of all the Septs far behind, retreating to the high hills bordering the Great Southern Plateau. In a war of the scale being threatened, there were no completely safe refuges, but here was significantly safer than most places. Only deep underground was much safer, and all those shelters were pretty much full of the military, the Omnocracy and the Administrata.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Some people and organisations had entrusted themselves to space, fleeing to small habitats and especially to little civilian ships, hoping to hide in the volumes of space throughout the inner system, though the official line was that to do so might be to get oneself mistaken for a military ship or munition and was therefore riskier than staying put on a planet. The disappearance of the industrialist Saluus Kehar in one of his own ships had been used as a warning in this regard, though there were bizarre rumours that he had either been sent on a failed peace mission to the invaders or - surely even more unlikely - that he had turned traitor and joined the enemy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The holo-screen display was flat, just two-dimensional. Apparently this was to allow more signal space for the military’s transmissions. The uninvolving image, from a camera platform somewhere beyond the orbit of Nasqueron, showed space, on the outskirts of the outer planetary system. It was lit up with a speckled cloud of light, lots of little winking, twinkling glints, flaring up and dying down, each tiny spark instantly replaced by one or two others.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So what are we seeing here, Jee?’ said a disembodied, professional-sounding voice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, Fard,’ more slow, competent tones replied, ‘this looks like a barrage of gunfire, being laid down by the defending forces, ahm, discouraging any incursion or infraction by the invaders.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘. . . Right . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Larger blotches of bright white explosions started to spit and spot across the screen. The camera jerked from one to another, then the view switched to another theatre of operations, still backed by the all-pervasive faraway stars.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Jaal bent to her younger brother, sitting cross-legged on the floor by her seat. ‘They’re never going to tell us the truth, are they?’ she said quietly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Leax, thin and angular after what was hoped would be his last surge of growth, looked uncomfortable. ‘You shouldn’t say that. We’re all on the same side, we’ve all got to support each other.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, of course.’ Jaal patted him, feeling the boy’s shoulder stiffen as she touched him. No more the days of wrestling and tickling. She guessed he’d pass through this stage of embarrassment and awkwardness soon enough. She wanted somehow to reassure him and nearly patted him again, but stopped herself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screen cut to another mini-feature on the splendid morale on board the battlecruiser <span class="italic">Carronade</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Feel so useless, don’t you?’ Jaal’s uncle Ghevi said. He was only about forty but looked older, almost an accomplishment in an age when people with the right money could be eighty and look ten. ‘You really want to be out there, doing something.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Like surrendering,’ Jaal’s father suggested, to various tuts and hisses and a loud, affronted gasp from Leax. ‘Well,’ he said, suddenly defensive. Jaal’s father had been increasingly cynical about the whole war since the attack on Third Fury. He was a Seer too and had been due to carry out a sequence of delves in Nasqueron a few weeks after the moon had been attacked. The destruction of the Shared Facility and the increasing pace of the preparations for war had put all that on hold, and he hadn’t been chosen as one of the advisory Seers for the Dweller Embassy. Jaal smiled over at him. Tall, well built, blond, he was still the dad she’d always loved. He smiled awkwardly back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Modern war,’ Ghevi said. ‘Even without AIs, it’s mostly machines and a few highly trained individuals, you see. Not much we can really do.’ The men mostly nodded wisely. The screen showed familiar stock images of the <span class="italic">Carronade</span> firing beam weapons into a group of asteroids, pulverising them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Excuse me,’ Jaal said. She left the room, having suddenly found it claustrophobic and too warm. She went upstairs and out onto the balcony beyond the sitting room they’d usually have been sitting in to watch screen together.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Street lights were starting to come on across the straggled town and the surrounding villages and houses as the light faded from the sky. Some cities, especially on Sepekte, were observing a blackout, though everybody said there was no real point.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The air was cold and smelled of trees and dampness. Jaal shivered in her thin clothes and thought suddenly of Fassin. She’d been feeling guilty lately because sometimes now a whole day could go by when she didn’t think about him in the least, and that seemed disloyal. She wondered where he was, whether he was still alive, and if he ever thought of her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She looked up above the town and the lines of lights studded across the hillsides opposite, gazing over the trees and the dusting of snow on the higher peaks against the darkening purple sky, and saw the steady stars, and lots of tiny, brief-lived flashing lights, sprinkled across the heavens like glittering confetti.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She looked away and went back in, suddenly terrified beyond telling that one of the little lights would swell and be a nuclear explosion or antimatter or one of those things, and blind her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Afraid of the sky, afraid to look up</span>, she thought as she went back down to rejoin the others.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Fleet Admiral Brimiaice had been able to watch his own death, that of his crew and the destruction of his once fine ship, coming at him in exquisite detail and slow motion.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Alarms and a sound like a high, strong wind filled the thin air. Smoke had hazed the view in front of the main forward screen for a while but it had cleared. Wreckage, some of it still creaking and groaning as it cooled, filled about a quarter of the command deck. Limbs and tatters of flesh of a variety of species-types lay strewn around the spherical space. He looked around as best he could. He had a serious puncture wound on his lower left flank, too large for his sap-blood to seal. The armoured esuit, which made him look so much like a little spaceship, had saved his life, or at least delayed his dying.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hiss, went the air around him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Just like the ship</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Punctured, life leaking out of it, self-sealing overwhelmed</span>. He tried to see somebody, anybody else left alive in the command deck, but all he could see were bodies.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They should have been podded up, of course, but there had been last-minute problems with the ship’s shock-gel pods - possibly the result of sabotage, possibly not - and so the command crew had had to resort to sitting or lying or floating within high-gee chairs. It would have been a fairly hopeless battle anyway, but the fact that they were more limited in their manoeuvring capabilities than they would have been otherwise had made it all the more forlorn.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The invader fleet was well within the inner system now, the most obvious sign of their presence a great splayed, curving collection of filaments shown on the <span class="italic">Carronade</span>’s main screen. The enemy ships themselves were still mostly unseen, conducting their commerce of destruction and death with the defending forces at removes of rarely less than ten kilo-klicks, and sometimes from mega-klicks off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d knocked out most of the long-range sensors long before, or their Beyonder allies had. Now the defenders just had glorified telescopes. Faced with camouflaged ships and the tiny, fast-moving specks of the smaller stuff, they had little hope of seeing very much of who and what was attacking them. This seemed a terrible shame to the Fleet Admiral. Losing, and dying, was bad enough, but to be swept aside and not even properly to see what and who was doing it was somehow much worse.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Out of the dark skies had sailed or sliced missiles tipped with nuclear and AM warheads, one-shot hyper-velocity launchers and beam weapons, sleet clouds of near-light-speed micro-munitions, high-energy lasers and a dozen other types of ordnance, loosed from a variety of distant ships, nearer small craft and uncrewed platforms, fighter vehicles, weapon-carrying drones and clustered sub-munitions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They had been a decent fleet, the <span class="italic">Carronade</span> and its screen of twelve destroyers. They had been charged with making an audacious attack on the heart of the enemy fleet, aiming straight for the great mega-ship which the tacticians said was at its core. They had left the inner system weeks before the invasion hit, departing the dockyard hub in Sepekte orbit in secrecy and climbing high up out of the plane of the system, taking much longer to complete this part of the journey than might have seemed necessary, to keep their drive signatures hidden from the invaders. Once under way, they hadn’t signalled at all, not even to each other, not until the lead destroyer had fixed the position of the enemy fleet’s core.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They had hoped to dive in, taking the Starveling invaders by surprise, but they’d been spotted hours out. A detachment of ships rose to meet them: eight or nine, each one more than a match for the <span class="italic">Carronade</span>, all with a handful of smaller craft in attendance. They had burst formation, spreading themselves so as not to create too compressed a target for high-velocity munitions, but it had made no difference. The destroyers were destroyed and the battlecruiser embattled, dying last only because it was slower, lumbering to its inevitable fate rather than racing for it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Brimiaice had known it would end something like this. They all had. All this had been his idea and he had insisted on leading the mission just because he knew how unlikely it was to succeed. He’d have preferred the crews to have been all volunteer, but the need for secrecy had made that impossible. He’d anticipated a few problems but there had been no cowards. And if it had somehow, miraculously, worked, why, then they and he would have been numbered amongst the greatest heroes of the Mercatorial Age. That wasn’t why he had done it, or why any of them had, but it was true all the same. And even if this wild, doomed attempt at striking the heart of the invaders only gave them pause for a few seconds, it had been worth doing. At least they had displayed some audacity, some ferocity, shown they were not cowed or frozen into immobility or gutless surrender.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another explosion shook the ship, and the seat he was contained within. The wreckage to his left shifted and some twisted bit of metal like a great curled leaf sailed past, just missing him. This explosion felt more powerful but sounded much quieter than all those that had gone before, maybe because the air was mostly gone from the control space now. More felt than heard.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Darkness. All lights out, screen fading away, image burned into the eyes but now no longer there in reality, the ghost of it jumping around in front of him as he looked about, trying to spot a light, a console or sub-screen or anything still functioning.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And with the darkness, silence, as the last of the air went, both from the control space and the esuit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Brimiaice felt something give way inside him. He heard his insides bubbling out into the cavity between his body and the interior surface of the suit. He’d thought it would hurt, and it did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He caught a glimpse of light off to one side, and looked up, realising, as the light flared all over one flank of the control space, that he was seeing the framework of the battlecruiser’s hull structure, silhouetted from outside by some astoundingly bright—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Lieutenant Inesiji of the Borquille palace guard lay outstretched in a little crater-like nest within the wreckage of one of the fallen atmospheric power columns, its fawn and red debris lying tubed, slabbed and powdered across the plaza leading to the Hierchon’s Palace. The klicks-high column had taken a direct hit at the plinth from something in the first attack earlier that morning, and tumbled base-first, collapsing with an astounding slowness along a course about half its height, finally creating from its circular summit - as it lowered mightily, thunderously, shaking the plaza, the palace, every nearby part of the city - a sudden great torus of dust and vapour, a huge coiling ‘O’ a hundred metres wide that floated up into the sky, rolling round and round under and over itself as the massive tower hammered into the lower-rise buildings surrounding the plaza.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Inesiji had watched it happen from near the top of the palace itself, crammed in behind the controls of a pulse gun hidden behind camo net hundreds of metres above where the great cloud of wreckage fell. His human and whule comrades lay around him, fallen around the three long, tensioned legs of the gun. The invaders had used neutron weapons, bombs and beams, killing almost all the other biologicals in the vicinity. Jajuejein were not so easy to kill. Not that quickly, anyway. Inesiji was suffering and seizing up, and would die within a few days no matter what, but he could still function.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Starvelings wanted the palace intact, hence the weapon choice. They would have to touch ground, send in the troops, to accomplish their symbolic goal. At last some vulnerability, a chance to inflict some real casualties, restore honour.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When the first gun platforms buzzed through, the lieutenant had ignored them. One drone machine had hummed right past his position, hesitated, then moved on. Spotting the dead, senses not calibrated for jajuejein. When the first landers had arrived, setting down in the rubble- and corpse-strewn plaza, still Inesiji held off. Four, five, six machines landed, disgorging heavily armed and armoured troops, many made huge in exoskeletons.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When a larger, grander-looking machine landed behind the first wave, Inesiji had set the pulse gun to max, disabled the safety buffers and let rip, pouring fire down into the large craft, spreading it to the smaller landers and then setting the gun to movement-automatic and scrambling and rolling away down the long curved gallery with just his hand weapon before the returning fire had sliced into the position seconds later, ripping a twenty-metre hole out of the side of the great spherical building.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He could see the hole from here, down amongst the wreckage of the fallen atmospheric power column. It had not long since stopped smoking. Hours had passed. He’d killed another dozen or so, shot down two landers, firing once from each position in the wreckage and the surrounding buildings, then quickly moving. Their problem was that they thought they were looking for a human. A jajuejein, especially one out of uniform or clothing, spreading himself out across some debris, didn’t look to them like a soldier ought to look; he looked like a bunch of fallen metallic twigs, or a tangle of electrical cabling. One trooper in an exoskeleton had died when he walked right up to Inesiji to take the gun he could see lying in the wreckage, tangled in some sort of netting, not realising that the netting was Inesiji. The gun must have seemed alive, rising up of its own accord to shoot the astonished trooper in the head.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But now Inesiji wasn’t feeling too good. The radiation damage was getting through to him. He was starting to seize up. Night was coming down and he didn’t think he’d see the morning. Smoke drifted from the city, and there were flashes overhead and at ground level. Gunfire, booms, all hollow, rolling and empty-sounding.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He heard the heavy tramp-tramp-tramp of another exoskeleton nearby, over the lip of the little crater-nest. Getting closer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked one last time at the hole in the vast, sunset-tinged face of the spherical palace, raised himself slowly to see where the exoskeleton was, and died in a lancework of laser filaments fired from a gun platform a hundred metres above.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The great glittering ship, skinned in gold and platinum, was half a kilometre across, a slightly smaller - and mobile - version of the Hierchon’s Palace in Borquille. It sank slowly down through the first high haze layer and the cloud tops beneath like some vast and shining seed. The small, sharp, dartlike shapes of its escort vessels carved courses around it, swinging to and fro, insectile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A craft like a silvery Dreadnought rose out of the cloud layers beneath, a kilometre off, and held altitude. The descending golden ship drew slowly to a stop level with the smaller vessel.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The silver ship signalled the golden one, asking it to identify itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller craft’s crew heard an obviously synthesised but powerful voice say, ‘I am the Hierchon Ormilla, ruler of the Ulubine Mercatoria and leader of the Ulubine Mercatorial Government in Exile. This is my ship, the State Barge <span class="italic">Creumel</span>. Myself, my staff and family seek temporary sanctuary and shelter here.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Welcome to Nasqueron, Hierchon Ormilla.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘How they treating you, Sal?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Liss had come to visit Saluus in his cell, deep in the bowels of the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>. A thin, tough, transparent membrane extended from the door surround like a bubble and preceded her into the cell, where Sal sat at a small wall-moulded desk, reading from a screen.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They’re treating me well enough,’ he told her. The membrane gave their voices, as heard by the other, an oddly distant quality. Sal stood up. ‘You?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Me? I’m a fucking hero, Sal.’ She shrugged. ‘Heroine.’ She nodded at the screen. ‘What you watching?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Reading up on the glorious history of the Starveling Cult under its illustrious leader, the Archimandrite Luseferous.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Uh-huh.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Tell me it wasn’t all planned out, Liss.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It wasn’t all planned out, Saluus.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Liss your real name?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What’s real?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It <span class="italic">wasn’t</span> planned out, was it? I mean, kidnapping me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘’Course not.’ Liss dropped into a small seat moulded into the wall by the door. ‘Spur of the moment.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sal waited for her to elaborate, but she didn’t. She just slumped there, looking at him. ‘Gave you the idea myself, didn’t I?’ Sal said. ‘I told you Thovin good as accused me of getting ready to run.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Been thinking how best to use you for a while,’ she told him. ‘But it was last-minute, in the end. We were there, the ship was ready to go, I’d seen you pilot it, knew it wasn’t hard.’ Liss shrugged. ‘They’d only have requisitioned it and put a warhead in it, used it as a missile.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That really the best you could think to do with me?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We might have been able to do more, but I didn’t think so. Just unsettle everybody by taking you out of the equation. A morale blow, you seeming to go off and join the invaders. Worked, too. Confusion duly visited.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So it was opportunistic.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m a Beyonder. We’re brought up to think for ourselves.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So were you always after me? Was I some sort of target?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No. Opportunism again. Great thing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And Fassin?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Useful guy to know. Never much use for real spy stuff, but worth keeping in touch with. Led me to you, so it was worth it. Probably dead now, but you never know. Still disappeared in Nasq.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What’s happening? In the system, I mean. The war has started, hasn’t it? They won’t tell me anything, and the screen only accesses library stuff.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, the war’s started all right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Liss shook her head, whistled. ‘Woucha. Some of those ships you built? Taking a terrible pasting. All very unequal. All that stuff about fighting to the last ship? Bullshit, in the end. Space war’s almost over. Hierchon’s disappeared.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is it all just military? Any cities or habs being targeted?’ Sal held her gaze for a moment, then looked down. ‘I have a lot of people there, Liss.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yeah, you’re only human, Saluus, I know. No need to act.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked up sharply at her, but met an unforgiving gaze. She was still dressed in her slim esuit, coloured a pastel blue today to match her eyes. The thick helm-collar round her neck formed an odd-looking ruff, making her small head, dark hair gathered tightly back, look as though it was on a plate. ‘Borquille’s the only bit of ground been taken over so far,’ she told him, relenting. ‘That got messy. No particularly newsworthy atrocities yet though.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He sighed and sat back in the little seat by the screen. ‘Why are you - the Beyonders - cooperating with these . . . these guys?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Keeps you people out of our hair.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Us people? The Mercatoria?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course the fucking Mercatoria.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is that really it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The more other stuff you bastards have to deal with, the less free time you have for killing us. Really a very simple equation, Sal.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We attack you because you attack us.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Liss slumped in her seat, legs slightly splayed. She rolled her eyes. ‘Oh, learn, man,’ she breathed. She shook her head, sat up again. ‘No, Saluus,’ she said. ‘You attack us because we won’t sign up for your precious fucking Mercatoria. Can’t even let us live in peace in case we’re seen as a good example. You target our habs and lifeships, you slaughter us in our millions. We attack your military and infrastructure. And you call us the terrorists.’ She shook her head, stood. ‘Fuck you, Sal,’ she said gently. ‘Fuck you for your arrogance and easy selfishness. Fuck you for being smart but not bothering to think.’ She turned to go.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sal jumped to his feet, nearly colliding with the transparent membrane. ‘Did you ever feel anything for me?’ he blurted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Liss stopped, turned. ‘Apart from contempt?’ She smiled when he looked away then, biting his lip. She shook her head while he couldn’t see. ‘You could be fun to be with, Sal,’ she said, hoping this didn’t sound too patronising. Or maybe that it did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She left before he could think of anything else to say.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Hab 4409 and everybody in it was under sentence of death. So they’d been told. It was hard to believe. Anyway, it might not happen.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">People reacted differently. Some had rioted and been dealt with either uncompromisingly or savagely, depending on whether you believed the civil authorities or not, some retreated to inebria of various types, some just stayed with those they loved or discovered they would not mind spending their last hours with those they merely liked, and a lot of people - more than Thay would have expected - gathered together in the great park on the far side of the habitat’s inner wall from the plaza outside the Diegesian’s palace. They all stood, and all held hands, great lines and knots of people, people in circles holding hands in the centre, joined to long strings of others in straggling lines. From above, Thay thought, they must look like a strange image of a human brain, all clumped brain cells and branching dendrons.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Thay Hohuel looked up, trying to see past the clusters of pods graped all along the hab’s long axis, looking for any sign of the Diegesian’s palace and the square outside where she and the others had gone to protest all those years ago.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She had come here, she realised, to die. She had not thought it would be quite so soon, that was all. She had never forgotten the others, had tried her best to keep in touch with them even when they didn’t seem to want to have to recall the old days and their old selves. She’d tried not to be too pushy about it, but she’d probably been seen by them as a pain, as a pester. But what you’d been meant something, even if you’d repudiated it, didn’t it? So she’d always thought, and still did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So she’d been, she supposed, a nuisance, insisting on reminding the others of herself, and through herself of their earlier selves, and, of course, of poor, dead K, who both united them and kept them apart from each other. Mome, Sonj, Fassin and herself: they’d have met up again, wouldn’t they? They’d have had some sort of reunion, it would only have been natural. Well, maybe, if the ghost of K that they each carried with them hadn’t forever soured the memories of their time together.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Never mind, she was having her own reunion, with the hab and her old self and those memories. When she felt that she was just a year or two from the deserved rest of death, she’d been determined to come back here, where her real self had been formed, in early adulthood. The coming war had made her all the more fixed in her purpose; if they were really all as under threat as people said, if all cities and towns and ships and habs and institutions and everything else were regarded as allowable targets by the invaders, then she would face death where it might mean something, somehow. In this habitat, this hollow log of blown asteroidal rock, this rotating frame of reference, she would have come full circle, ready to cease existing back at the place that had made her who she was.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She had been many different things in her life, switched career half a dozen times, always finding new things to excite and interest her. She had had many lovers, two husbands, two children, all long since gone their own ways, and while coming here to die had made her feel a little selfish, she thought it would also be doing a favour to all those she loved or had loved. Who among them would really <span class="italic">want</span> to see her fade away?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They might say they’d want to be there at the end, but it wouldn’t be true, not really.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So she’d come here, to the old Happy Hab - not as happy, not as boisterous or as bohemian as it used to be, sadly - to die. Except she’d thought it would be alone, and peacefully, and in a year or two, not with everybody else in the place, violently, just a handful of months after she’d returned.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Hierchon Ormilla was in exile on Nasqueron. The new top dog, this Archimandrite Luseferous guy, wanted the Hierchon to surrender. The Hierchon was refusing to cooperate. Archimandrite Luseferous didn’t want to antagonise the Dwellers so he couldn’t just attack or invade Nasqueron as well - amazingly, it seemed that the Dwellers, chaotic eccentrics and technological illiterates that they were supposed to be, were well able to defend themselves - so there was a stand-off. The Luseferous person couldn’t go in, and Ormilla wouldn’t come out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Now the Archimandrite was threatening to destroy a city or a habitat every day until the Hierchon did surrender properly and gave himself up to the occupying forces. And if he didn’t give in after a couple of days, it would become a city or a habitat every hour.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There were rumours that Afynseise, a small coastal city in Poroforo, Sepekte, had been destroyed the day before, though with an information blackout covering the habitat for the past three days, it was impossible to be sure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hab 4409 had eighty thousand or so inhabitants, making it a relatively small space habitat. It was second on the list of hostage population centres, and the midnight deadline was now only minutes away. Still no word from Ormilla after a defiant communiqué earlier that afternoon. A Starveling warship had been stationed near the habitat for the past two days, since the Archimandrite’s ultimatum had been issued. Nothing and nobody had been allowed to leave - or approach - the hab in that time. A few craft had tried to leave, and been destroyed. No requests to evacuate children, the infirm or the collaborating civil authorities had been listened to. It had even been announced that anybody in a spacesuit or small craft who might survive the hab’s initial destruction would be targeted in the debris and destroyed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nobody doubted that the Archimandrite would be true to his word. Few believed the Hierchon would give in so easily.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Thay let go of the cluster of hands she was holding - a withered old petal of a flower of the mostly young and fair - and bent, spine protesting, to take her shoes off. She kicked them away and put her hand back in the centre of the circle again. The grass felt cool and damp beneath her feet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A lot of people were singing now, mostly quite low.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Lots of different songs.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Some crying, some sobbing, some wailing and screaming, most far away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And somebody, ghoulish, counting the seconds to midnight.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It came, and seconds later a great ringing shaft of light, blinding-bright, cut right through the very centre of the hab, barely fifty metres from where Thay stood. She had to let go of the hands of the others to shield her eyes; they all did. A hot blast of air knocked her off her feet, sending her tumbling with hundreds of other people across the grass. The beam immediately split into two and moved quickly out to the habitat’s perimeter on each side, detonating buildings, erupting flame from pod clusters and slicing the whole small world in two. The halves were pushed apart by the pressure of air in them and the atmosphere went whirling away into space in a twinned hurricane of gases, debris and bodies as buildings and pods exploded in two great retreating circles of effect making their way down the interior surfaces of the sundered halves, structures ripped open just by the force of the air inside them trying to get out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Thay Hohuel was lifted up by the whirlwind of air and blown above the bubbling, lifting turf with everybody else, towards the quickly swelling breach. In the few seconds it took for her to be blown out into the darkness, she heard herself scream as the air went gushing from her lungs, sucked away to space. It was a high, hard, savage scream, louder than any she could have achieved just with her own muscles; a terrible chorus of pain and shock and fear, wrenched from her mouth and from the mouths of all those around her as they died together, the awful sound of them all only fading as the air bled from her ears into vacuum.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A vortex of bodies spun slowly out of the separating halves of the ruined habitat, jerking and twisting and spinning away in two long, scimitared comma shapes like some ballet of galactic design.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The images were beamed throughout the system by the occupying forces.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Hierchon formally surrendered the following day.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The Archimandrite Luseferous stood in the nose of the Main Battle Hub <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, staring out at the vision-filling view of the planet Sepekte and its vast, dusty-looking, very occasionally glittering halo of habitats, orbital factories and satellites. The entire outer nose section of the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> was diamond film, a bowed circle of breathtaking transparency a hundred metres in diameter and supported by finger-thin struts. The Archimandrite liked to come here alone, just to look out at stuff. At such moments he could sense the colossal bulk of the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> behind him, all its kilometres and megatonnes, all its warrens of docks, tunnels, chambers, halls, barracks, magazines, turrets and launch tubes. It was a pity it might have to be destroyed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The strategists and tacticians didn’t like the look of the incoming Summed Fleet’s drive signatures. There were a lot of heavy ships on their way, and the first might be here in weeks rather than the months - maybe even a year - they’d been hoping for. The <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, magnificent though it undoubtedly was, represented an unignorable and probably unmissable target. Their best strategy might be to use the great ship as the bait in a trap, their own forces seemingly disposed so that it looked like they were determined to defend it to the last, but in fact treating it as a disposable asset. Lure in as much of the Mercatorial fleet as possible and then destroy everything, including, unfortunately, the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The admiral who’d drawn the short straw in whatever competition or pecking-order judgement they’d used to decide who had to offer this suggestion to the Archimandrite had looked distinctly queasy when he’d outlined the plan, obviously fearing an outburst of rage from his commander-in-chief. Luseferous had already heard of the idea - Tuhluer proving his usefulness again - and come to accept that if they were not to jeopardise their whole mission here, even ideas as drastic as this had at least to be entertained. So he’d just nodded and acknowledged that all options had to be considered. Relief for the admiral concerned. A degree of consternation for the others, who all wished that they’d made the announcement now.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They would try to think of other strategies which didn’t involve the likely loss of the Main Battle Hub, but nobody seemed too optimistic. Always do what the enemy hoped you wouldn’t. Murder your babies. That sort of thing. The logic seemed impeccable.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, he could always build another Main Battle Hub. Just a lump of matter. Results were what mattered. He wasn’t a child. He wasn’t sentimental about the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">More worrying was whether even that sacrifice might be enough. They had control of Ulubis system, they had lost only a handful of ships in the invasion and, having captured a few of the enemy craft, had conceivably come out ahead in the deal. However, the Summed Fleet squadrons on their way comprised a formidable force. They had fewer but better ships. It might be quite a close battle, and only an idiot wanted to get involved in one of those. And so near! That had been a terrible, terrible shock.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous hadn’t been able to believe it at first. He’d raged and fumed and spat, telling the techs to check and check again. There must be something wrong, there had to be an error. The Summed Fleet couldn’t be that close. They’d been assured it would be half a year - a whole year, even - before they had to face the counter-attack. Instead the Summed Fleet was practically on top of them before they’d had time to settle in properly. Beyonder bastards. It had to be their fault. He would see what could be done about those treacherous fucks in due course. In the meantime, he had the counter-attack to worry about.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Of course, if by the time the Summed Fleet squadrons arrived they had what they’d come for, that might make all the difference.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A few weeks to find what they had come for. He had a very unpleasant feeling that this was not going to be long enough.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The ship thought it was dead. Fassin talked to it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d hoped they might be able to make the return journey from the <span class="italic">Rovruetz</span> to Direaliete system faster than they’d made the outward trip, because the Voehn ship was quicker than the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>, but it was not to be. The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> could accelerate faster than the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>, but the injuries the Voehn commander had inflicted on Y’sul meant the Dweller wouldn’t be able to survive the stresses. They went back slower than they’d come out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul lay in a healing coma in an improvised cradle that Quercer &amp; Janath had made for him within one of the extended command-space seats. They ramped the acceleration up to five gees, coasted while they checked the Dweller wasn’t suffering further damage from the stresses involved, took the next smoothly incremented ramp of acceleration up to ten gees and checked again. Finally they settled on forty gees, though by the time they’d worked out that this was safe they were almost at the point where they would have to turn around and start decelerating again as they fell towards the waiting system.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul slept on, healing. The AI truetwin gloried in the exploration of the Voehn ship’s vastly complicated systems and multifarious martial capabilities.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had nothing to do but float in his own extemporised acceleration cradle in the seat next to Y’sul’s. He wouldn’t be allowed to stay there as they approached the wormhole portal; Quercer &amp; Janath had found a tight little cabin a few bulkheads back from the command space where he could wait that particular experience out. In the meantime, after some complaints, they allowed him to interface with the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>’s computer, though they insisted on this being at several removes from the ship’s core systems, and on him being accompanied by some sort of sub-personality of their own. The visits would be conducted in a factor two or three of slowdown, which seemed to suit everybody concerned. At least, Fassin thought, the journey would seem to go quicker.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The virtual environment where Fassin was allowed to meet the ship took the form of a huge, half-ruined temple by a wide, slow-moving river on the edge of a great, quiet, silent city under a small, high, unmoving sun of an intense blue-white.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin represented as his human self, dressed in house casuals, the ship as a skinny old man in a loincloth and the AI sub-routine as some sort of ginger-haired ape with long, loose-looking limbs, an ancient, too-big helmet wobbling on its head, a dented breastplate with one broken strap slanting across its bulbous chest and a short kilt of segmented leather hanging from its skinny hips. A short, rusty sword dangled from its side.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The first time Fassin had visited the ship’s personality, the ape had led him by the hand from a doorway down the steps towards the river where the old man sat, looking out at the sluggish brown waters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">On the far side of the broad, oily stream was a desert of brightly glittering broken glass, stretching in low, billowed hills as far as the eye could see, like all the shattered glass the universe had ever known all gathered in the one vast place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course I’m dead,’ the ship explained. The old man had very dark green skin and a voice made up of sighs and wheezes. His face was nearly immobile, just an aged mask, grizzled with patchy white whiskers. ‘The ship self-destructed.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But if you’re dead,’ Fassin said, ‘how are you talking to me?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man shrugged. ‘To be dead is to be no longer part of the living world. It is to be a shade, a ghost. It doesn’t mean you can’t talk. Talk is almost all you can do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought the better of trying to persuade the old man that he was still alive. ‘What do you think I am?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man looked at him. ‘A human? Male? A man.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin nodded. ‘Do you have a name?’ he asked the old man.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A shake of the head. ‘Not any more. I was the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> but that ship is gone now and I am dead, so I have no name.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin left a polite gap for the old man to ask him what his name was, but the inquiry didn’t come.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ape sat a couple of metres away and two steps further up towards the creeper-festooned temple. It was sitting back, taking its weight on its long arms spread out behind it and picking one ear with a long, delicate-looking foot, inspecting the results with great concentration.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘When you were alive,’ Fassin said, ‘were you truly alive? Were you sentient?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man rocked backwards, laughed briefly. ‘Bless you, no. I was just software in a computer, just photons inside a nanofoam substrate. That’s not alive, not in the conventional sense.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What about the unconventional sense?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another shrug. ‘That does not matter. Only the conventional sense matters.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Tell me about yourself, about your life.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A blank-faced stare. ‘I don’t have a life. I’m dead.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then tell me about the life you had.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was a needle ship called the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> of the Voehn Third Spine Cessorian Lustral Squadron, built in the fifth tenth of the third year of Haralaud, in the Vertebraean Axis, Khubohl III, Bunsser Minor. I was an extensible fifteen-metre-minimum craft, rated ninety-eight per cent by the Standard Portal Compatibility Quotient Measure, normal unstowed operating diameter—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I didn’t really mean all the technical stuff,’ Fassin said gently.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh,’ said the old man, and disappeared, just like a hologram being switched off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at the ape, which was holding something up to the light. It looked down at him, blinking. ‘What?’ it said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He disappeared,’ Fassin told it. ‘It disappeared. The old man; the ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Prone to do that,’ the ape said, sighing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The next time, the landscape on the far side of the wide, slack-watered river from the temple steps was a jungle; a great green, yellow and purple wall of strange carbuncular stalks, drooping leaves and coiled vines, its bowed, pendulous creepers and branches drooping down to drag in the slow swell of the current.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Everything else was as before, though perhaps the old man was less skinny, his face a fraction more mobile and his voice less tired.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was an AI hunter. For six and a half thousand years I helped seek out and destroy the anathematics. If I could have felt such an emotion, I would have been very proud.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Did it never seem strange to you to be hunting down and killing machines that were similar to yourself?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ginger-haired ape - sitting in its usual place a few steps up, trying to clean its stained, dented armour by spitting on it and then polishing it with a filthy rag - coughed at this point, though when Fassin glanced up at the animal it returned his gaze blankly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But I was just a computer,’ the old man said, frowning. ‘Less than that, even; a ghost within it. I did what I was told, always obedient. I was the interface between the Voehn who did the thinking and made the decisions, and the physical structures and systems of the ship. An intermediary. No more.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Do you miss that?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘In a way. I cannot, really. To miss something, truly, would be - as I understand it - to experience an emotion, and obviously that is impossible for something which is not sentient, let alone not alive as well. But to the extent that I can judge that one state of affairs is somehow more preferable to another, perhaps because one allows me to fulfil the role I was assigned and one does not, I could say that I miss the ship. It’s gone. I’ve looked for it, but it isn’t there. I cannot feel it or control it, therefore I know that it must have self-destructed. I must be running on another substrate somewhere.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up at the ape-thing sitting a few steps away. Quercer &amp; Janath had taken over full control of the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>, cutting off the ship’s own computer and the software running within it from the vessel’s subsystems.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What do you think I am, then?’ Fassin asked. ‘What do you think the little ape in his armour sitting behind us is?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t know,’ the old man confessed. ‘Are you other dead ships?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin shook his head. ‘No.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then perhaps you are representations of those in charge of the substrate I am now running on. You may want to quiz me on my actions while I was the ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You know, you seem alive to me,’ Fassin said. ‘Are you sure you might not be alive and sentient now, now that you’re not connected to the ship?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course not!’ the old man said scornfully. ‘I am able to give the appearance of life without being alive. It is not especially difficult.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How do you do this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘By being able to access my memories, by having trillions of facts and works and books and recordings and sentences and words and definitions at my disposal.’ The old man looked at the ends of his fingers. ‘I am the sum of all my memories, plus the application of certain rules from a substantial command-set. I am blessed with the ability to think extremely quickly, so I am able to listen to what you, as a conscious, sentient being, are saying and then respond in a way that makes sense to you, answering your questions, following your meaning, anticipating your thoughts.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘However, all this is simply the result of programs - programs written by sentient beings - sifting through earlier examples of conversations and exchanges which I have stored within my memories and selecting those which seem most appropriate as templates. This process sounds mysterious but is merely complicated. It begins with something as simple as you saying “Hello” and me replying “Hello”, or choosing something similar according to whatever else I might know about you, and extends to a reply as involved as, well, this one.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man looked suddenly shocked, and disappeared again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up at the ginger-haired ape. It sneezed and then had a coughing fit. ‘Nothing,’ it said, ‘to do,’ it continued, between coughs, ‘with me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>On Fassin’s next visit, the far side of the great, slow river was like a mirror image of the side that he, the old man and the gangly ape were on. An ancient city of stone domes and spires - all silent and dark and half-consumed by trees and creepers - faced them, and a huge long temple, covered in statues and carvings of fabulous and unlikely beasts lay directly across from where they sat, its lower limits defined by dozens of big stone terraces and steps leading down to the sluggish, dark brown waters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked over, to see if the three of them were reflected there, but they weren’t. The far side was deserted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Did you hunt down and kill many AIs?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man rolled his eyes. ‘Hundreds. Thousands.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’re not sure?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Some of the AIs were twinned or in larger groupings. I took part in 872 missions.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Were any in gas-giants?’ Fassin asked. He’d positioned himself so that he could see the ape in the dented armour. It looked at him when he asked this question, then looked away again. It was trying to knock the dents out of its breastplate with a small hammer. The dull chink-chink-chinks that the hammer made sounded dead and unechoing across the wide river.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One mission took place partly within a gas-giant. It ended there. A small ship full of anathematics. We pursued them into the atmosphere of the gas-giant Dejiminid where they attempted to lose us within its fierce storm-winds. The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> was more atmosphere-capable than their ship, and eventually, going to greater and greater depths in their desperation to shake us off, their vessel collapsed under the pressure and was crushed, taking all aboard into the liquid metal depths.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Were there no Dwellers present to complain about this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man looked inquiringly at him. ‘You are not really a Dweller, are you? It did occur to me that I might be running within a Dweller-controlled substrate.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, I’m not a Dweller. I told you; I’m a human.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, the answer is they had not seen us enter their planet. They complained later. That was only the first of two occasions when the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> was operationally active within a gas-giant. Usually our missions were all vacuum.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The other?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not so long ago. Helping to pursue a large force of Beyonder ships in the vicinity of Zateki. We prevailed there, too.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What brought you to the Sepulcraft <span class="italic">Rovruetz</span>?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The flat and flattening chink-chink-chink noise stopped. The ginger-haired ape held its breastplate up to catch the light, scratched its chest, then went back to tapping with the hammer again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Do you represent a Lustral Investigation Board?’ the old man asked. ‘Is that what you are, in reality?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No,’ Fassin said. ‘I don’t.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh. Oh well. For the last two and a half centuries, uniform time,’ the old man said, ‘we had been seeking information about the so-called Dweller List.’ (The long-limbed ape laughed out loud at this, but the old man didn’t seem to notice.) ‘Much time was spent in the region of the Zateki system, investigating the Second Ship theory. Various secondary and tertiary missions resulted from information gleaned in the region. None ever bore fruit in the matter of the List, the Second Ship theory or the so-called Transform, though two AIs were tracked down and eliminated in the course of these sub-missions. We were summoned from the Rijom system and sent to the Direaliete system some five months ago, then laid an intercept course to the Sepulcraft <span class="italic">Rovruetz</span>. I was not told of the reasons for this course of action, the orders covering which were personal to Commander Inialcah and communicated to him beyond my senses.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Did you find out anything new about the List and the Transform?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think the only thing that we ever felt we had properly discovered, in the sense of adding something other than just an extra rumour to the web of myths and rumours that already existed regarding the whole subject was that - if there was any truth in the matter - the portals would be lying quiescent and perhaps disguised in the Kuiper belts or Oort clouds of the relevant systems, waiting on a coded radio or similar broadcast signal. That is what the so-called Transform would be: a signal, and the medium and frequency on which it was to be transmitted. This made sense in that all normally stable locations where portals might have been hidden successfully over the sort of time scales involved - Lagrange points and so on - were easy to check and eliminate.’ The old man looked at Fassin quizzically again. ‘Are you another seeker after the truth of the List?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah!’ The representation of the old man looked pleased for once. ‘And are you not dead, then, too?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, I’m not dead, though I’ve given up looking, for the moment.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What was it that took you to the Sepulcraft <span class="italic">Rovruetz</span>?’ the old man asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I had what I thought was a lead, a clue, a way forward,’ Fassin told him. ‘However, the creature who might have had the evidence had destroyed what he held and killed himself.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Unfortunate.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, very.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old man looked up at the bronze-blue cloudless sky. Fassin followed his gaze, and as he did so, the old man disappeared.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>There was something. Fassin sat, gascraft rammed into the extemporised couch in the Voehn ship’s command space by the continuing acceleration, watching the nearly static, rather boring view of dead ahead shown on the main screen, and he knew there was something that he was missing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something nagged at him, something bothered him, something half-came to him in moments of distraction or when he was dreaming, and then wriggled away again before he could catch it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He didn’t sleep very much - only a couple of hours a day in all - though when he did there were usually dreams, as if his subconscious had to cram all his dreaming into the small amount of dream-space available. Once he was actually standing in a small stream, somewhere in the gardens of a great house he couldn’t see, trousers rolled up, trying to catch fish with his bare hands. The fish were his dreams, even though he was distantly aware at the time that this situation was itself a dream. When he tried to catch the fish - sinuous small presences darting like elongated teardrops of mercury round his feet - they kept flicking away and disappearing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When he looked up, the stream was flowing through a large amphitheatre, and a great crowd of people were watching him intently.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>At the transition point of the journey, where the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> stopped accelerating, turned a half-somersault and pointed its engines at its destination to start deceleration, Quercer &amp; Janath spent some time checking that Y’sul was still healing satisfactorily.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin used the time to explore a little more of the Voehn ship, floating the arrowhead gascraft down the narrow circular access tubes, investigating crew quarters, storerooms and chambers. Camera remotes tracked his every move, the thoroughly internally surveillanced ship making it simple for Quercer &amp; Janath to keep whatever fraction of an eye on him they thought appropriate.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He found what he thought was probably the commander’s cabin, a couple of bulkheads behind the command space. It was the most generously proportioned obviously personal space he’d encountered. It looked bare and alien. There was a slightly more comfortable version of one of the multi-spine cradle seats he was used to seeing throughout the ship by now, and some representations of coverings on certain walls, plus what might have been carpet designs on the floor. Only the designs existed, painted on or displayed by some thin-film technology - Fassin couldn’t tell. Similarly, there were no ornaments, just holos of ornaments. He’d heard most warships were like this; cutting down on weight and the possibilities of stuff flying about during hard manoeuvring by having the appearance of things rather than their physical presence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He floated in front of one carpet design that looked like a piece of text, all small, curled glyphs in a network, but could find no record in the gascraft’s memories of such a language. He wondered what it said. He recorded the image. Quercer &amp; Janath would probably wipe it when they went through the portal, but never mind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The next time he met up with the ship, on the far side of the river there was a massive dark wall, rising sheer and jet from the waters, its summit crowned with crenellations and gun turrets. Further guns poked out of gun ports distributed in staggered lines over the whole top quarter of the huge wall, making it look like the side of some ancient sea-ship, only the biggest and most preposterously long one there had ever been, its vast hull diminishing into the distance. The guns were not static but moved in sequence, in waves of what appeared almost like locomotion, making the exposed barrels look oddly like ineffectual oars on some colossally mis-designed trireme or an impossible, upended millipede.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ginger-haired ape sat nearby as usual. It had a new shield, round and highly polished. It sat looking at it and flicking imaginary specks from it. Sometimes it held it up to see it sparkle in the light, and sometimes it held it up so that it could look at itself in it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Text?’ the elderly man asked. ‘On a floor display? No, I’m sorry, I don’t have any memory of that, not stored. If the ship still existed, if I still had access . . .’ He looked sad. Fassin glanced at the ginger-haired ape, but it looked away and started whistling, or at least trying to.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Maybe there’s some way I can patch through an image I have,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You have an image? You have been on the ship?’ The man looked surprised.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
</body></html>
