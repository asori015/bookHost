<div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He waved a hand. ‘The opposition has been light,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Your main fleet should be at the outskirts of Ulubis system in, what? One more year?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Something like that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This is somewhat later than we had all planned for.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It is a big invasion fleet. It took time to put together,’ Luseferous said, trying to show that he resented her implied criticism while also giving the impression that what she thought was of no great importance to him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They <span class="italic">were</span> behind schedule, though. He had personally assured these - temporary - allies of his that he would be ready to invade nearly a full half-year earlier than it now looked would be possible. He supposed it was his fault, if fault it was. He liked to keep his fleet together rather than let it split up according to speed and then re-form as needed for the invasion proper. His admirals and generals insisted (though not too strongly if they knew what was good for them) that they didn’t need all units of the fleet to be together at all times, but Luseferous preferred it. It seemed more cohesive, more impressive, just more tidy and pleasing somehow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It also meant that the Beyonders would shoulder rather more of the responsibility for preparing Ulubis system for invasion than they might have expected, so that the invasion fleet’s job would be all the easier and the Beyonders’ - hopefully much-depleted - forces would be in a position of weakness relative to his own mass of ships.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Still,’ Lascert said, ‘we imagine your advance units may be attacking even now.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We’ve had some automated scout/warning ships and high-speed drone attack craft there or on their way for a while now,’ Luseferous told her. ‘Always best to be prepared for any eventuality. Some needed reprogramming but we believe they should be effective in beginning the softening-up process.’ He smiled. He watched her react to the clear diamond teeth. ‘I am a great believer in the usefulness of spreading a little panic, marshal. Better still, a lot of panic. After a long-enough exposure, people will welcome any power that brings an end to uncertainty, even if they might have resisted it before.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The marshal smiled too, though it looked like she was making an effort. ‘Of course. And we thought now might be an appropriate moment to talk in more depth about what you see your strategy being once you reach Ulubis.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I intend to take it, marshal.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed. Of course, it may be quite well defended.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I expect it might. That’s why I’ve brought such a big fleet with me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were between systems, way out in the empty wilderness of near-nothingness less than a year from Ulubis. The Beyonder fast cruiser and its two escort destroyers had rendezvoused with his own fleet only hours earlier, skid-turning and matching velocities with a grace and rapidity that he could see his own naval people envied. Fine ships, indeed. Well, they had the ships and he had the systems; just another opportunity to trade, maybe. Now those three fast ships lay embedded in a fleet of over a thousand craft, even if they were rather plodding in comparison.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘May I be frank, Archimandrite?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He gave her a good wide look at his deep red eyes. ‘I expect no less.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are concerned at the possible level of civilian casualties if Ulubis is assaulted over-aggressively.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Now why would she say that?</span> Luseferous thought to himself with a sort of inward chuckle.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked at his private secretary, then at his generals and admirals. ‘Marshal,’ he said reasonably, ‘we are going to invade them. We are going to attack them.’ He smiled broadly, and could see his admirals and generals grinning along with him. ‘I think aggressiveness is . . . essential, yes?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He could hear light laughter from one or two of his top brass. People thought that having people so in awe of you that they were frightened to tell you bad news and always laughed when you laughed (and so on) was a bad thing, and supposedly insulated you from what was really going on, but if you knew what you were doing, it didn’t. You just had to adjust your perceptions. Sometimes everybody laughed, sometimes only a few, and sometimes who kept quiet and who made a noise told you a lot more than when you asked them to just speak out and tell you the truth. It was a sort of code, he supposed. He was just lucky to be naturally adept at it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Aggression and judgement are both required, Archimandrite,’ the marshal said. ‘We know you to possess both, of course.’ She smiled. He did not smile back. ‘We merely seek an assurance that your troops will act in a manner which will bring you further praise and greater fame.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Praise?’ the Archimandrite said. ‘I inspire terror, marshal. That’s my strategy. I’ve found that to be the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that people learn what is good both for them and for me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘For glory, then, Archimandrite.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Be merciful for glory?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The marshal thought about this for a moment. ‘Ultimately, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I shall conquer them as I see fit, marshal. We are partners in this. You don’t tell me what to do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am not trying to, Archimandrite,’ the marshal said quickly. ‘I accept what you must do, I am merely delivering a request regarding the manner in which it is done.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And I have heard your request and I will pay it all due heed.’ This was a form of words Luseferous had heard somebody use once - he couldn’t remember who or where - which, when he’d thought about it, he thought was rather good, especially if you said it slightly pompously: slowly, gravely even, keeping a straight face so that the person you were talking to thought you were taking them seriously and might even hope that you would do as they had asked rather than - at best - ignore them completely. At worst - as far as they were concerned - you’d do the opposite of whatever they asked, just to spite them, precisely to prove you wouldn’t be pushed around . . . though that got tricky; then people might try to make you do one thing by pretending to favour another, and even without that complication you were still altering your behaviour because of something they had said, which was giving them a sort of power over you, when the whole point of everything the Archimandrite was doing was so that <span class="italic">nobody</span> could say they had any power over him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Power was everything. Money was nothing without it. Even happiness was a distraction, a ghost, a hostage. What was happiness? Something people could take away from you. Happiness too often involved other people. It meant giving them power over you, giving them a hold on you that they could exercise whenever they wanted, taking away whatever it was that had made you happy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous had known happiness and he’d had it taken away. His father, the only man he’d ever admired - even while hating the old bastard - had got rid of Luseferous’s mother when she became old and less attractive, replacing her, when Luseferous was barely into his teens, with a succession of young, erotically desirable but soulless, uncaring, selfish young women, women he’d wanted for himself but despised at the same time. His mother was sent away. He never saw her again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His father had been an Omnocrat for the Mercatoria, in the industrial complexes of the Leseum Systems. He’d started out at the bottom, as a Peculan (cynically, the very name implied that the office-bearer would need to be corrupt to make any sort of decent living, so incurring a history of criminality that could always be dredged up against them if they ever stepped out of line later). He’d become an Ovate, worked his way through the many gradations of that estate, then ascended to the office of Diegesian, in charge of a district of a city, then a small industrial city, then a medium-sized city, then a large city, then a continental capital. He became an Apparitor when his immediate superior died in the arms of a shared lover. That lover did very well for a while - his consort, in effect - then grew demanding and met an untimely end too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His father had never told him if he’d had her killed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Equally, he’d never told his father that the woman had lately become his lover, too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">From Apparitor his father rose to Peregal, in charge of first an orbiting fab/hab cluster, then a continent, then a sizeable moon, with all the trappings of power and wealth and glamour such a post presented in a thriving, connected set of systems such as Leseum. At this point, for the first time in his life, his father had appeared finally to appreciate the position he’d reached. He’d seemed to relax and start enjoying life.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It ended there. Finally setting himself up for the next jump, to Hierchon, his father, who had amassed a great fortune dispensing charters and contracts to the merchants and manufacturers of the many systems, took pity on a favoured Apparitor who was somewhat down on his luck, cut him in on a deal and a kickback he didn’t really need to and found himself denounced, tried and beheaded for gross corruption within a month. The same young Apparitor then took his position.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous, convinced from early on that he could never compete with his father in his own sphere, and anyway always intrigued by the nature of religion and faith, had joined the Cessoria a few years earlier. He’d been a Piteer, a junior priest, at the time of his father’s trial. They had made him one of his father’s confessors, and he’d accompanied him to the execution ring. His father had been brave at first, then he’d broken. He’d started crying, begging, promising anything (but only all the things he’d already lost). He clutched at Luseferous’s robes, howling and beseeching, burying his face. Luseferous knew they were watching him, that this moment was important for his future. He pushed his father away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His rise through the Cessoria was swift.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He would never be as powerful as his father, but he was clever and capable and respected and on an upward course within an important but not too dangerous part of one of the greatest meta-civilisations the galaxy had seen. He might have been content with that, and never put himself in a position of weakness the way his father had.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then the Disconnect happened. A swathe of portal destruction had swung across the million-star volume all around Leseum back in the time of the Arteria Collapse, leaving only the bunched Leseum systems themselves connected inside a vast volume of backwardness. The system of Leseum9 had been important, seemed vital and felt unthreatened until their own disconnect came millennia later, courtesy of some vast bicker within the ongoing chaos of the Scatter Wars, an essentially meaningless difference of opinion between three pretending sides which until then practically nobody had heard of. By the time it was all over, nobody would hear of those sides again, save as history. The damage was done, though; the portal near Leseum9 had been destroyed and an enormous volume around it had been cut off from the rest of the civilised galaxy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Everything changed then, including what you had to do to retain power, and who might contest for absolute power.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His father, nevertheless, had taught Luseferous everything, one way or another, and one of the most important things was this: there was no plateau. In life, you were either on your way up or on your way down, and it was always better to be on your way up, especially as the only reliable way to keep going up was to use other people as stepping stones, as platforms, as scaffolding. The old saying about being nice to people on the way up so that they’d be nice to you when you were on your way back down was perfectly true, but it was a defeatist’s saying, a loser’s truism. Better to keep going up for ever, never to rest, never to relax, never to have to descend. The thought of what might happen to you at the hands of those you’d already offended, exploited and wronged on the way up - those that still lived - was just another incentive for the serious player never even to think about easing off the pace, let alone starting to fall back. The dedicated competitor would keep presenting himself with new challenges to take on and conquer, he would seek out new levels to ascend to, he would always look for new horizons to head towards.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Treat life like the game it was. This might be the truth behind the Truth, the religion Luseferous had been raised within as an obedient member of the Mercatoria: that nothing you did or seemed to do really mattered, because it was all - or might be all - a game, a simulation. It was all, in the end, just pretend. Even this Starveling cult he was titular head of was just something he’d made up because it sounded good. A variation of the Truth with added self-denial every now and again, the better to contemplate the gullibility of people. People would swallow anything, just anything at all. Apparently some people found this dismaying. He thought it was a gift, the most wonderful opportunity to take advantage of the weak-minded.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So you seemed cruel. So people died and suffered and grew up hating you. So what? There was at least a chance that none of it was real.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And if it <span class="italic">was</span> all real, well, then life was struggle. It always had been and it always would be. You recognised this and lived, or fell for the lie that progress and society had made struggle unnecessary, and just existed, were exploited, became prey, mere fodder.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He wondered to what extent even the supposedly feral and lawless Beyonders understood this basic truth. They let women rise to the pinnacle of their military command structure; that didn’t bode particularly well. And the marshal didn’t seem to have realised that when he’d said he’d heard her request and would pay it all due heed, it meant nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, thank you, Archimandrite,’ she said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Still, he smiled. ‘You will stay? We shall have a banquet in your honour. We have had so little to celebrate out here, between the stars.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘An honour indeed, Archimandrite.’ The marshal gave that little head nod again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">And we shall try to pick each other’s brains over dinner</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">My, what highbrow fun. Give me a planet to plunder any day.</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>- Do you have any idea where we are? the colonel signalled, using a spot-laser. They reckoned this was their most secure form of comms.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Zone Zero, the equatorial, Fassin sent. - Somewhere ahead of the latest big storm, about ten or twenty kilo-klicks behind the Ear Festoon. I’m checking the latest update they loaded before the drop.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were floating in a slow eddy around a gentle ammonia upwell the diameter of a small planet, about two hundred klicks down from the cloud tops. The temperature outside was relatively balmy by human standards. There were levels, places in almost all gas-giants where a human could, in theory, exist exposed to the elements without any protective clothing at all. Of course they would probably need to be prone and lying in a tub of shock-gel or something similar because weighing six times what their skeleton was used to coping with would make standing up or moving around problematic, their lungs would have to be full of gillfluid or the like, to let them breathe within a mix of gases which included oxygen only as a trace element, and also to let their ribs and chest muscles work under the pressure of that gravitational vice, plus they wouldn’t want to be exposed to a charged-particle shower, but all the same: by gas-giant great-outdoors standards, this was about as good as it humanly got.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Colonel Hatherence found it a bit hot, but then as an oerileithe she would be more at home closer to the cloud tops. She had already loudly pronounced her esuit undamaged and capable of protecting her anywhere from space-vacuum down to Nasqueron’s ten-kilo-klick level, where the pressure would be a million times what it was here and the temperature somewhat more than half what it was on the surface of Ulubis star. Fassin chose not to join in a mine’s-better-than-yours competition; his own gascraft was also space-capable in an emergency but untested at those depths.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d tried contacting Apsile in the drop ship but had come up with static. The passive positioning grid cast by the equatorial satellites was functioning but both scale-degraded and patchy, indicating there were some satellites gone or not working.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Knowing where you were in Nasqueron or any gas-giant was important, but still less than half the story. There was a solid rocky core to the planet, a spherical mass of about ten Earth-sized planets buried under seventy thousand vertical kilometres of hydrogen, helium and ice, and there were purists who would call the transition region between that stony kernel and the high-temperature, high-pressure water ice above it the planet’s surface. But you had to be a real nit-picker even to pretend to take that definition seriously. Beyond the water ice - technically ice because it was effectively clamped solid by the colossal pressure, but at over twenty thousand degrees, confusingly hot for the human image of what ice was supposed to be like - came over forty thousand vertical kilometres of metallic hydrogen, then a deep transition layer to the ten-kilo-klick layer of molecular hydrogen which, if you were of an especially imaginative turn of mind, you might term a sea.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Above that, in the relatively thin - at a mere few thousand kilometres - but still vastly complicated layers reaching up towards space, were the regions where the Dwellers lived, in the contra-rotating belts and zones of rapidly spinning gases which - dotted with storms great and small, spattered with eddies, embellished with festoons, bars, rods, streaks, veils, columns, clumps, hollows, whirls, vortices, plume-heads, shear fronts and subduction flurries - girdled the planet. Where the Dwellers lived, where everything happened, there was no solid surface, and no features at all which lasted more than a few thousand years save for the bands of gas forever charging past each other, great spinning wheels of atmosphere whirling like the barely meshed cogs in some demented gearbox a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres across.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The convention was that the equatorial satellites followed the averaged-out progress of the broad equatorial zone, establishing a sort of stationary parameter-set from which everything else could be worked out relatively. But it was still confusing. Nothing was fixed. The zones and belts were relatively stable, but they shot past each other at combined speeds of what humans were used to thinking of as the speed of sound, and the margins between them changed all the time, torn by furiously curling eddies writhing this way and that, or thrown out, compressed and disturbed by giant storms like the Great Red Spot of the Solar System’s Jupiter, riding between a zone travelling one way and a belt going the other like a vast squashed whirlpool caught in some mad clash of violently opposed currents, developing, raging and slowly dissipating over the centuries that humanity had been able to watch it. In a gas-giant, everything either evolved, revolved or just plain came and went, and the whole human mindset of surfaces, territory, land, sea and air was thrown into confusion.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Add the effects of a vastly powerful magnetic field, swathes of intense radiation and the sheer scale of the environment - you could drop the whole of a planet the size of Earth or Sepekte into a decent-sized gas-giant storm - and the human brain was left with a lot to cope with.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And all this before one took into account the - to be generous - playful attitude which the Dwellers themselves so often exhibited to general planetary orientation and the help, or otherwise, conventionally seen as being fit and proper to be extended to directionally challenged alien visitors.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I thought we’d be in the midst of them, the colonel sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Dwellers? Fassin asked, studying the complex schematic of who and what might be where at the moment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes, I imagined we would find ourselves in one of their cities.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They both looked around at the vast haze of slowly swirling gas, extending - depending on which frequency or sense one chose to experience it in - a few metres or a few hundred kilometres away on every side. It felt very still, even though they were part of the equatorial zone and so being spun around the planet at over a hundred metres a second, while swirling slowly around the upwelling and rising gradually with it too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin felt himself smiling in his wrapping of shock-gel.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, there’s a lot of Dwellers, but it’s a big planet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It seemed odd to be explaining this to a creature whose kind had evolved in planets like this and who surely ought to be familiar with the scale of a gas-giant, but then oerileithe, in Fassin’s admittedly limited experience of them, often did display a kind of half-resentful awe towards Dwellers, entirely consistent with a belief that the instant you dropped beneath the cloud tops you’d find yourself surrounded by massed ranks of magisterial Dwellers and their astoundingly awesome structures (a misapprehension it was hard to imagine any Dweller even considering correcting). The oerileithe were an ancient people by human standards and by those of the vast majority of species in the developed galaxy, but - with a civilisation going back about eight hundred thousand years - they were mere mayflies by Dweller standards.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A thought occurred to Fassin. - You ever been in a Dweller planet before, colonel?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Indeed not. A privilege denied until now. Hatherence made a show of looking about. - Not unlike home, really.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another thought occurred. - You <span class="italic">did</span> receive clearance? Didn’t you, colonel?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Clearance, Seer Taak?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- To come down. To enter Nasq.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ah, the colonel sent. - Not as such, I do confess. It was thought that I would be remote delving with you and your colleagues, from the Shared Facility on the Third Fury moon. Braam Ganscerel himself took the time to assure me of this personally. No objection was raised regarding such a presence. I believe that permission was in the process of being sought for me to accompany you physically into the atmosphere if that became necessary - as indeed it now has - however, the last that I heard in that regard indicated that the relevant clearances had yet to materialise. Why? Do you envisage there being a problem?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh, shit</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The Dwellers, Fassin told her, - can be . . . pernickety about that sort of thing. <span class="italic">Pernickety</span>, he thought. They were liable to declare the colonel an honorary child, give her a half-hour start and set off to <span class="italic">hunt</span> her. - They take their privacy quite seriously. Unauthorised entries are severely discouraged.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, I’m aware of that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You are? Good.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I shall throw myself upon their mercy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Right. I see.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">You are either quite brave and possessed of a decent sense of humour</span>, Fassin thought, <span class="italic">or you really should have done more homework</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So, Seer Fassin Taak, in which direction ought we to proceed?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Should be a CloudTunnel about four hundred klicks . . . that way, Fassin sent, turning the gascraft to point more or less south and slightly down. - Unless it’s moved, obviously.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Shall we? the colonel said, drifting in that direction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Going to ping one of our sats, let them know we’re alive, Fassin told her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- This is wise?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Was it wise?</span> Fassin wondered. There had been some sort of attack on the Seer infrastructure around Nasqueron, but that didn’t mean the whole near-planet environment had been taken over. On the other hand . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How fast can that esuit go? he asked the colonel.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- At this density, about four hundred metres per second. About half that, on sustained cruise.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin’s arrowcraft could just about keep pace with that. Disappointing. He was still hoping to give the colonel the slip at some point. It looked like he wasn’t going to be able to just outrun her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ping sent, he told Hatherence. - Let’s go.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They went, quickly. They’d got about a hundred metres away when a flash of violet light ripped the cloud apart behind them and a stark, short-lived beam-cluster splayed through the volume of gas they’d been floating within a few seconds earlier. Further beams radiated out from the initial target point, pulsing through the atmosphere in slowly spreading semi-random stabs. One flicked into existence about fifty metres from them, booming and crackling. All the rest were much further away and after a minute or so they ceased altogether.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Somebody would seem to be ill-disposed towards you, Seer Taak, the colonel sent as they flew through the gas.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So it would appear.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The flash and EMP came a couple of minutes after that. A low, rumbling concussion caught up with them some time later.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Was that a <span class="italic">nuke</span>? Fassin sent. His instruments seemed to leave no other interpretation, but he still found it hard to believe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I am unaware of any phenomenon able to mimic one so convincingly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fucking hell.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I float corrected. Somebody would seem to be <span class="italic">extremely</span> ill-disposed towards you, Seer Taak.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The Dwellers are <span class="italic">not</span> going to be happy, he told Hatherence. - Only they’re allowed to let off nukes in the atmosphere, he explained. - And it isn’t even fireworks season.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>They found the CloudTunnel about where Fassin had thought it ought to be, only a hundred kilometres out laterally and two kilometres further down: bang on by Nasqueron standards. The CloudTunnel was a bundle of a dozen or so carbon-carbon tubes like some vast, barely braided cable-cluster floating in the midst of an unending cloudscape of gently billowing yellow, orange and ochre. The CloudTunnel’s two main tubes were about sixty metres in diameter, the smallest - basically comms and telemetry wave guides - less than half a metre. The whole cluster had looked thread-thin when they’d first caught sight of it, tens of kilometres away, but up close it looked like a hawser fit to tether a moon. A great, deep rushing sound rumbled from inside the two main pipes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What now? the colonel sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We see if my vicarious kudos credit is still good.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin used one of the arrowcraft’s manipulators to prod one of the wave guides, working the filaments through the tube’s protective sheath without breaking it. A hair-thin wire extended into the matrix of light filling the narrow tube. Information streamed from the far end of the wire, into the gascraft’s biomind, its transitional systems and then into Fassin’s head, forming a coded chaos of babbling sound, wildly scintillating visuals and other confused sensory experiences. The interruption in the light streams had already been noticed and allowed for. A pulse of information aimed right at the filament sent an identity request and inquired whether assistance was required, otherwise stop interfering with a public information highway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A human, Fassin Taak, privileged to be Slow Seer at the court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, he sent. - I’d like some assistance in the shape of transport at the given location, bound for Hauskip City.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was told to wait.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Fassin Taak, Out-Bander, Stranger, Alien, Seer, Human! And . . . what’s this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This is Colonel Hatherence of the Mercatorial Military-Religious Order the Shrievalty Ocula, an oerileithe.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good day, Dweller Y’sul,’ Hatherence said. They had switched to using ordinary sound-speech.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A little dweller! How fascinating! Not a child, then?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul, a sizeable mid-adult a good nine metres or so in diameter, rolled through the gas and, extending one long spindle-arm, clunked a fist-bunch (bink-bink-bink!) on the esuit of the Colonel.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hellooo in there!’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence’s discus of esuit leaned to one side under the rain of not-so-gentle blows. ‘Pleased to meet you,’ she replied tersely.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not a child,’ Fassin confirmed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in a giant bowl-like room, roofed with slate-diamond micrometres thin, in a Thickeneers’ Club in Hauskip City.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hauskip lay within the equatorial zone of Nasqueron, one of the hundred thousand or so major conurbations in that particular atmospheric band. Seen from the right angle in a sympathetic light, it looked a lot like the internal workings of an ancient mechanical clock, multiplied and magnified several thousand times. From far enough away, or just seen in a schematic, it resembled millions of toothed-looking wheels caught up in amongst each other, with larger sets of wheels interconnecting with them through hubs and spines and spindles, themselves linking up with still greater sets of wheels. The whole mighty, slowly gyrating and spinning assemblage, easily a couple of hundred kilometres in diameter, floated within a thick soup of gas a hundred kilometres beneath the cloud tops.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The city was the hub for several CloudTunnel lines. Once an empty car had made its way to the access hatch nearest to where Fassin and Hatherence pitched up alongside the CloudTunnel, it had taken two changes of line, riding in the same car, for Fassin and the colonel to get there through the network of partially evacuated, high-speed transit tubes. The whole journey had taken one of Nasqueron’s short day-night cycles. They had each slept for most of the time, though just before Fassin had dozed off, the colonel had said, ‘We go on. You agree, major? We continue our mission. Until we are ordered to cease.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I agree,’ he said. ‘We go on.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The TunnelCar had docked, sphinctered its way through a TunnelBud wall in Hauskip’s Central Station and sped through the gelatinous atmosphere straight to the equatorial Eighth Progression Thickeneers’ Club, where Y’sul, Fassin’s long-time guide/mentor/guard had been attending a party to celebrate the Completion and Expulsion Ceremony of one of the club’s members.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dwellers started out looking like anorexic manta rays - this was in their brief, occasionally hunted childhood phase - then grew, fattened, split most of the way down the middle (adolescence, kind of), shifted from a horizontal to a vertical axis and ended up, as adults, basically, resembling something like a pair of large, webbed, fringed cartwheels connected by a short, thick axle with particularly bulbous outer hubs onto each of which had been fastened a giant spider crab.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Part of the transition from recent- to mid-adulthood involved a period called Thickening, when the slim and flimsy discs of youth became the stout and sturdy wheels of later life, and it was customary for Dwellers to join a club of their approximate contemporaries while this was taking place. There was no specific reason for Dwellers to band together at this point in their lives, they just in general enjoyed joining clubs, sodalities, orders, leagues, parties, societies, associations, fellowships, fraternities, groups, guilds, unions, fractionals, dispensationals and recreationalities, while always, of course, leaving open the possibility of taking part in ad hoc non-ceremonial serendipitous one-time gatherings as well. The social calendar was crowded.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul had invited them to this private book-crystal-lined library room in his Thickeneers’ Club rather than to his home so that, as he explained, if they were too boring or in too great a hurry, he could get back without an over-great delay to his chums taking part in the ceremonial dinner and spree in the banqueting hall below.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, Fassin, good to see you!’ Y’sul said. ‘Why have you brought this little dweller with you? Is she food?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, of course not. She is a colleague.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course! Though there are no oerileithe Seers.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘She is not a Seer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then not a colleague?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘She has been sent to escort me, by the Mercatorial Military-Religious Order the Shrievalty Ocula.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see.’ Y’sul, dressed in his best smart-but-casual finery, all brightly coloured fringes and lacily ornate ruffs, rocked back, rotating slightly, then came forward again. ‘No, I don’t! What am I saying? What is this “Ocula”?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It took a while to tell. After about a quarter of an hour - this all, thankfully, in real-time, with no slow-down factor - Fassin thought he’d pretty much briefed Y’sul as well and as completely as he could without giving too much away. The colonel had contributed now and again, not that Y’sul seemed to have taken any notice of her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul was about fifteen thousand years old, a full-adult who was perhaps another one or two millennia away from becoming a traav, the first stage of Prime-hood. At nine metres vertical diameter (not including his semi-formal dinner clothes, whose impressive body ruff added another metre), he was about as large as a Dweller ever got. His double disc was nearly five metres across, the modestly clothed central axle barely visible as a separate entity, more of an unexpected thinning between the two great wheels. Dwellers shrank very slightly as they aged after mid-adulthood and slowly lost both hub and fringe limbs until, by the time they were in their billions, they were often nearly limb-disabled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even then they could still get about, as a rule. Their motive force came from a system of vanes extending from the inner and outer surfaces of their two main discs. These extended to beat - sometimes twisting to add extra impetus or to steer - and lay flat on the backstroke, so that a moving Dweller seemed to roll through the atmosphere. This was called roting. Very old Dwellers often lost the use of - or just lost - the vanes on the outside of their discs, but usually retained those on the inside so that no matter how decrepit they might get, they could still wheel themselves around.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It boils down,’ Y’sul said at the end, ‘to the fact that you are looking for the choal Valseir, to resume subject-specific studies in a library within his control.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Pretty much,’ Fassin agreed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Y’sul, you have always been a great help to me. Can you help me in this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Problem,’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Problem?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Valseir is dead and his library has been consigned to the depths, or split up, possibly at random, amongst his peers, allies, families, co-specialists, enemies or passers-by. Probably all of the above.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Dead?’ Fassin said. He let horror show on the signalling carapace of the gascraft; a quite specific whorl pattern which indicated being intellectually and emotionally appalled at the demise of a Dweller friend/acquaintance not least because they had died in the course of pursuing a line of inquiry that one was oneself deeply fascinated by. ‘But he was only a choal! He was billions of years from dying!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir had been about a million and a half years old and on the brink of passing from the Cuspian level to that of Sage. Choal was the last phase of being a Cuspian. The average age of progressing from Cuspian-choal to Sage-child was over two million years but Valseir had been judged by his elders and allegedly betters as being ready even at such a modest count of time. He was, or had been, a one-and-a-half-million-year-old prodigy. He had also, last time Fassin had seen him, seemed strong, vigorous and full of life. Agreed, he spent most of his life with his rotary snout stuck in a library and didn’t get out much, but still Fassin could not believe he was dead. The Dwellers didn’t even have any diseases he could have died of. How could he be <span class="italic">dead</span>?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yachting accident, if I recall,’ Y’sul said. ‘Do I?’ Fassin sensed the Dweller radioing an inforequest to the patch-walls of the library room. ‘Yes, I do! Yes, a yachting accident. His StormJammer got caught in a particularly vicious eddy and it came apart on him. Skewered with a main beam or a yard arm or something. On a brighter note, they salvaged most of the yacht before it descended to the Depths. He was a very keen sailor. Terribly competitive.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘When?’ Fassin asked. ‘I heard nothing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not long ago,’ Y’sul said. ‘Couple of centuries at the most.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There was nothing on the news nets.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Really? Ah! Wait.’ (Another radioed inforequest.) ‘Yes. I understand he left instructions that in the event of his death it was to be regarded as a private matter.’ Y’sul flexed his hub-mounted spindle-arms on either side. All of them. Right out. ‘Quite understand! Done the same myself.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is there any record of what happened to his library?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul rocked back again, a pair of giant conical wheels rotating slowly away, then pitching forward once more. He hung in mid-gas and said, ‘D’you know what?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, there isn’t! Is that not strange?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We . . . I would really like to look into this matter further, Y’sul. Can you help us in this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I most certainly . . . ah, talking about news nets, there is something about an unauthorised fusion explosion not far from the point you accessed the CloudTunnel from. Anything to do with you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh, shit</span>, Fassin thought, again. ‘Yes. It would appear that somebody is trying to kill me. Or possibly the colonel here.’ He waved at Hatherence’s esuit, still floating next to him. She had been silent for some time. Fassin was not certain this was a good sign.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see,’ Y’sul said. ‘And talking about the good colonel, I am struggling to discover her authorisation. For being here at all, I mean.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well,’ Fassin said, ‘we were forced to take refuge in Nasqueron, some time before we imagined it would be necessary, due to unprovoked hostile action. The colonel’s permissions were being sought some time before we left but had not yet come through when we had to make our emergency entry. The colonel is, technically, here without explicit permission, and therefore throws herself upon your mercy as a shipwreckee, a wartime asylumee and a fellow gas-giant dweller in need of shelter.’ Fassin turned and looked at the colonel, who shifted about her vertical axis to return his gascraft-directed gaze. ‘She claims sanctuary,’ he finished.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Provisionally given, of course,’ Y’sul said. ‘Though the precise meaning of “unprovoked” might be challenged in a wider context, and the exact definition of “shipwreckee”, equally, could well be open to dispute if one wished to be picky. That aside, though, do I understand there is some sort of dispute in progress, out amongst you people?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You understand correctly,’ Fassin told the Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, not another one of your wars, please!’ Y’sul protested, with a rolling-back of his whole body which was actually relatively easy for a human to interpret, correctly, as an equivalent of rolling one’s eyes. (Though, to be fair, there were quite a lot of Dweller gestures with this translation.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, pretty much, yes,’ Fassin told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Your passion for doing each other harm never ceases to amaze, delight and horrify!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m told there is to be a Formal War between Zone 2 and Belt C,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I too am told that!’ Y’sul said brightly. ‘Do you really think it will happen? I’m not optimistic, frankly. Some appallingly good negotiators have been drafted in, I understand . . . Ah. Your hull carapace, doing the job of standing in, feebly, for the body you so sadly lack, bears marks upon it which I take to mean you were being sarcastic earlier.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Never mind, Y’sul.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Right then, shan’t. Now then: Valseir. There is a point of congruency.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There is?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘With what? Between what and what?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘His demise and this war we’ve been promised!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Really?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes! His old study - it is in the current zone of disputation, I believe.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But if it’s already been broken up—’ Fassin began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, there are bound to be back-ups, and I’m not even sure the old fellow has been finally put to rest.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘After two hundred years?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Come now, Fassin, there were matters of probate.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And it’s in the war zone?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Very likely, yes! Isn’t it exciting? I think we ought to go there immediately!’ Y’sul waved all his limbs at once. ‘Let’s form an expedition! We shall go together.’ He looked at Hatherence. ‘You can even bring your little friend.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>- I have been considering whether to attempt to communicate with your Shared Facility, via your satellites or directly, the colonel told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I wouldn’t, Fassin sent. - But if you decide you must, tell me before you try. I want to be well out of the volume.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You think the same sort of attack directed against us following your ‘ping’ might be directed against us here?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Probably not here, in a Dweller city. But then, why risk it? We don’t know that whoever’s been shooting at us quite understands what they’d be letting themselves in for, so they might just waste us and have to deal with the consequences later. We won’t be around to jeer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We need to find out what is going on, Major Taak, Hatherence informed him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I know, and I’m going to send a request for information up to a sat from a remote site as soon as I’ve checked out what’s been going on via the local nets.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel floated over to look at the enormous though ancient and highly directional flat screen which Fassin was using in his attempt to find out what had been happening. They were in Y’sul’s home, a ramshackle wheel-house in a whole vast district of equally shabby-looking wheel-houses hanging on skinny spindles underneath the city’s median level like a frozen image of an entire junkyard’s worth of exploded gearboxes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul had escorted them back from his club in a state of some excitement. Then he’d left them alone, taken his servant Sholish and gone off in search of a decent tailor - his usual tailor had most inconveniently taken it into his mind to change trades and become a Dreadnought rating; probably trying to get in on the ground floor of this upcoming war.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What have you found? the colonel asked, watching the flat screen fill with an image of the Third Fury moon. - Hmm. The moon appears almost undamaged.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- This is an old recording, Fassin explained. - I’m trying to find an updated one.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Any mention of the hostilities?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not very much, Fassin told her, using a manipulator to work the massive, stiff controls of the old screen. - There’s been a mention on a minority radio news service, but that’s it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It is regarded as news, though? This is encouraging, I think?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, don’t get too excited, Fassin sent. - We are talking about a station some amateurs run for the few people like themselves who are actually interested in things happening in the rest of the system; maybe a few thousand Dwellers out of a planetary population of five or ten billion.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The number of Dwellers in Nasqueron is really that uncertain?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh, I’ve seen estimates as low as two billion, as high as two hundred, even three.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I encountered this degree of uncertainty in my research, Hatherence said as Fassin switched manually between channels, data sets and image-trails. - I recall thinking it must be a mistake. How can one be two base-ten orders of magnitude out? Can’t one just ask the Dwellers? Don’t they know themselves how many they are?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You can certainly ask, Fassin agreed. He put some humour into his signal. - An old tutor of mine used to say of questions like this that the answers will prove far more illuminating regarding Dweller psychology than they will concerning their actual subject.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- They lie to you or they don’t know themselves?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That is a good question too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- They must have an idea, the Colonel protested. - A society has to know how many people it contains, otherwise how would it plan infrastructure and so on?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin felt himself smiling. - That’s how it would work in pretty much any other society, he agreed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There are those who would assert that Dwellers are not in fact civilised, the colonel said thoughtfully, - that they could scarcely be said to possess a society in any single planet, and on a galactic scale cannot be said to constitute a civilisation at all. They exist rather in a state of highly developed barbarism.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’m familiar with the arguments, Fassin told her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Would you agree?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No. This is a society. We are in a <span class="italic">city</span>. And even just in the one planet, this is a civilisation. I know the definitions will have changed over the years and you might take a different view from me, but in the history of my planet we’d refer to a civilisation based around a single river system or on a small island.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I forget how small-scale one has to think when dealing with planets with solid-surface living-environments, the colonel said, apparently without meaning to insult. - But even so, the definition of a civilisation has to move on when one ascends to the galactic stage, and the Dwellers, taken as a whole, might seem deficient.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I think it comes down to one’s own definition of the terms, Fassin said. - Hold on; this looks promising.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He swung back from a mosaic of sub-screens to a single moving image. Third Fury again, though this time looking hazier, less defined, and shot from some distance away. The shallow domes of the Shared Facility were obvious if not clear, down near one tipped edge of the little moonlet. A flash on the surface away to one side, and a semi-spherical cloud of debris, spreading. A glowing crater left where the flash had come from.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- This looks like yesterday, Hatherence said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Does, doesn’t it? Fassin agreed. - Looks like it was taken from high up on Belt A or the south of Zone 2. Just some amateur pointing a camera. Fassin found how to spin the stored recording back and then forward, then discovered how to zoom in. - And that’s us.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They watched a cerise spot appear on a glittering blister near the edge of the Shared Facility, and could just make out the grainily defined debris of the hangar dome blowing outward in front of a sudden haze of quickly dissipating mist. A tiny dark grey dot rose from the shattered dome and crawled away: the drop ship, making its desperate dive for the planet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin spun the recording forward. The moon’s position altered quickly, flying away across the dark sky as Third Fury continued on its orbit and whoever was recording the images was whirled away in the opposite direction by the twenty-thousand-kilometre-wide jet stream beneath them. - Definitely Band A, Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A brilliant white flash washed out the whole screen. It faded, and a crater kilometres across was left. Debris spread everywhere like a flower’s seed-head, just ready to shed, caught in a sudden hurricane. The interior of the crater was white, yellow, orange, red. The debris continued to spread. It looked like most of it would stay in more or less the same orbit as Third Fury itself</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They both watched in silence. The moon had changed shape. It wobbled, seemed to partially collapse in on itself, slowly, plastically resuming a spherical form after losing so much of its earlier mass. Yellow cloud tops came up in a near-flat line to meet it and the small glowing globe spun under the horizon.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin let the recording play out and start to loop. He stopped it. The screen froze on the recording’s first image of Third Fury, almost overhead, just after the first impact.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That did not look like a survivable event, the colonel sent. Her sent voice sounded quiet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I think you’re right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I am very sorry. How many people would have been in the Shared Facility base?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A couple of hundred.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I saw no sign of your Master Technician’s craft, or of the attacks on us once we quit the drop ship.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin compared the recording’s time code with the gascraft’s own event list. - Those happened after what we saw here, he told the colonel. - Over the horizon from where this recording was taken, anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So much for back-up or reinforcements. The colonel turned towards him. - We still go on, though, yes?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So, now what, Fassin Taak?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We need to talk to some people.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘So you want to communicate with your own kind?’ Y’sul asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Via a relay at a remote site,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why haven’t you done so already?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I wanted to get your permission.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You don’t need my permission. You just find a remote dish and send away. I suspect any vicarious effect on my kudos level will be too small to measure.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in an antechamber of the city’s Administrator. The antechamber was a sizeable room furnished with wall hangings made from ancient CloudHugger hides, all yellow-red and whorled. A few sported the holes where the creatures had been punctured. One curved section of wall was a giant window, looking out over the vast floating scape of wheels that was Hauskip. Evening was starting to descend and lights were coming on throughout the city. Y’sul floated over to the window and caused it to hinge down by the unsubtle tactic of bumping into it reasonably hard. He then floated out over the impromptu bow of balcony so produced, muttering something about liking the view and maybe moving his own house up here. A breeze blew in, ruffling the old CloudHugger hides as though their long-dead occupants were still somehow fleeing from their hunters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Colonel Hatherence leaned over towards Fassin. - This kudos thing, then, she sent. - It is <span class="italic">really</span> how they calculate their worth?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’m afraid so.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So it’s the truth! I thought it was a joke.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Distinguishing between the two is not a Dweller strong point.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul wandered back, failing to shut the window. His vanes made a quiet burring noise as he roted through the gas towards them. ‘Give me the message,’ he said. ‘I’ll forward it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Via an out-of-the-way transceiver?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, just send to Sept Bantrabal, letting them know I’m all right and asking whether they’re okay at their end. I imagine they already know what happened to the Third Fury moon. You might ask them whether anything has been heard of Master Technician Apsile and the drop ship which escaped the moon’s assault, and what happened to the ships supposed to be protecting Third Fury.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ahem,’ the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They both looked at her. ‘Is this wise?’ she asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You mean should I pretend to be dead?’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That did occur to me. But there are people I’d like to know I’m alive.’ He thought of that glimpse of a flash which might have been something hitting ’glantine while Third Fury was being bombarded. ‘And I’d like to know my friends and family are all right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course,’ the colonel said. ‘However, I wonder if it might be more sensible for me to communicate with my superiors first. We might ask Dweller Y’sul here to let me use this remote relay. Once a more secure link had been established, perhaps via one of the warships, which I assume are still somewhere around the planet, a message might be sent to your Sept to let them know you are well. None of which need take long.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">While Hatherence had been speaking, Y’sul had floated right up to her, seemingly intent on peering through the front plate of her esuit, which was in fact completely opaque, and indeed armoured. Eventually he was within a centimetre of her, towering above the oerileithe. The colonel did not retreat. One of Y’sul’s rim limbs tapped - more delicately this time - on the colonel’s esuit casing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Would you mind not doing that, sir?’ she said frostily.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why are you still inside that thing, little dweller?’ Y’sul asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Because I am evolved for higher, colder levels with a different gas-mix and pressure gradient, Dweller Y’sul.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see.’ Y’sul drew back. ‘And you have a very strange accent and way with grammar. I swear this human speaks better than you do. What were you saying again?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was asking you kindly to refrain from making physical contact with my esuit.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, before that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was suggesting I make contact with my superiors.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Military superiors?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul turned to Fassin. ‘That sounds more interesting than your plan, Fassin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Y’sul, two hundred of my people died yesterday. If not more. I’d like—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes yes yes, but—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I might have to signal ’glantine direct, if no satellites are left,’ Hatherence was saying, as a tall door swung up in one wall and a Dweller in ceremonial clothes poked its rim out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll see you now,’ said the City Administrator.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">The Administrator’s office was huge, the size of a small stadium. It was ringed with holo-screen carrels. Fassin counted a hundred or so of the study stations, though only a few were occupied by Dwellers, mostly fairly young. There were no windows but the ceiling was diamond leaf, with most of the sections slid round to leave the place open to the rapidly darkening sky. Floatlamps bobbed, casting a soft yellow light over them as they followed the Administrator to her sunken audience area in the centre of the giant room.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You are pregnant!’ Y’sul exclaimed. ‘How delightful!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So people keep telling me,’ the Administrator said sourly. Dwellers were, for want of a better term, male for over ninety-nine per cent of their lives, only changing to the female form to become pregnant and give birth. Becoming female and giving birth was regarded as a social duty; the fact that the obligation was more honoured than not made it unique in Dweller mores. It contributed mightily to one’s kudos tally and anyway had a sort of sentimental attraction for all but the most determinedly misanthropic members of the species (statistically, about forty-three per cent). Still, it was undeniably a burden, and very few Dwellers went through the experience without complaining mightily about it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I myself have thought of becoming female, oh, several times!’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, it’s overrated,’ the City Administrator told him. ‘And particularly burdensome when one had an invitation to the forthcoming war that one is now apparently morally obliged to turn down. Please; take a dent.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They floated to a series of hollows in the audience area and rested gently within them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why, I too hope to be going to the war!’ Y’sul said brightly. ‘Well, somewhere very near it, at least. I have only just now returned from my tailor’s after being measured for the most lately fashionable conflict attire.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, really?’ the Administrator said. ‘Who’s your tailor? Mine just left for the war.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not Fuerliote?’ Y’sul exclaimed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The same!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He was mine also!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just the best.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Absolutely.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, I had to go to Deystelmin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is he any good?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Weeeelll.’ Y’sul waggled his whole double-discus. ‘One lives in hope. Good mirror-side manner, as it were, but will it translate into a flattering cut? That’s the question one has to ask oneself.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know,’ agreed the Administrator. ‘And off to become a junior officer on a Dreadnought!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not even that! A rating!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Very lowly, for someone so distinguished!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know, but a smart move. Getting in as a rating before the recruitment window even properly opens makes sense. The smoking-uniform effect.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah! Of course!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin tried making a throat-clearing noise in the midst of all this, but to no effect.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The smoking-uniform effect? The colonel light-whispered to him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Dead men’s shoes, Fassin explained. - They only promote from within once hostilities have begun. If he’s lucky this tailor’s Dreadnought will suffer heavy damage and lose a few officers and he’ll end up an officer after all. If he’s <span class="italic">really</span> lucky he could rise to admiral.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence thought about this. - Would a tailor, however distinguished, necessarily make a good admiral?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Probably no worse than the one he’d be replacing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The problem was that to the Dwellers all professions were in effect hobbies, all posts and positions sinecures. This tailor that Y’sul and the City Administrator were babbling on about would have had no real need to be a tailor, he was just somebody who’d found he possessed an aptitude for the pastime (or, more likely, for the gossiping and fussing generally associated with it). He would take on clients to increase his kudos, the level of which would increase proportionally the more powerful were the people he tailored for, so that somebody in a position of civil power would constitute a favoured client, even if that position of power had come about through a lottery, some arcanely complicated rota system or plain old coercive voting - jobs like that of City Administrator were subject to all those regimes and more, depending on the band or zone concerned, or just which city was involved. The City Administrator, in return, would be able to drop casually into just the right conversations the fact she had such a well-known, high-kudos tailor.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Obviously Y’sul had had sufficient kudos of his own to be able to engage the services of this alpha-outfitter too. People further down the pecking order would have employed less well-connected tailors, or just got their clothes from Common, which was Dweller for, in this particular case, off-the-peg, and in general just meant mass-produced, kudos free, available-as-a-matter-of-right-just-because-you’re-a-Dweller . . . well, pretty much anything, up to and including spaceships.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Though having seen round a few Dweller spaceships, Fassin thought the stack-’em-high-and-give-them-away-free approach had its limitations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed,’ Y’sul was saying. ‘My own bid for JO status has been languishing for centuries and wasn’t even mentioned this time round. Entering as a rating seems demeaning, but it could pay off big if there are casualties.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course, of course,’ the Administrator said, then fastened her gaze on the colonel. ‘What’s this?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘An oerileithe, a little dweller,’ Y’sul said, with what sounded like pride.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Gracious! Not a child?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Or food. I asked.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Pleased to meet you,’ the colonel said with as much dignity as she could muster. An oerileithe, it appeared, attracted even less respect amongst Dwellers than Fassin - and, he suspected, the colonel herself - had expected. The oerileithe had evolved relatively recently, quite independently of the vast, unutterably ancient mainstream of galactic Dwellerdom and as such were seen by their more venerable co-gas-giant-inhabitants as something between an annoying collective loose end and a bunch of impudent, planet-usurping interlopers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And this must be the Slow Seer.’ The Administrator looked briefly at Fassin’s gascraft before returning her gaze to Y’sul. ‘Do we need to talk slowly for it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, Administrator,’ Fassin said before Y’sul could reply. ‘I am running on your timescale at the moment.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How fortunate!’ She flicked to one side and stabbed at a screen remote, her frontal radius edge lit up by the holo’s glow. ‘Hmm. I see. So all the mayhem of the last day or two is your fault, then?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Has there been much mayhem, ma’am?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, the partial destruction of a close-orbit moon would fit most people’s definition of mayhem,’ the Administrator said pleasantly. ‘An attractive feature in the sky whenever one ventured towards the cloud tops. Been there millions of years, slagged within a few per cent of breaking up completely, a ring of debris scattered round its orbit, that orbit itself changed significantly, causing everything else up there to have to shuffle round to accommodate the alteration, a small bombardment of debris across three bands, some chunks narrowly missing several items of infrastructure with more than sentimental value and others setting off automatic planetary-defence laser batteries, a cascade of satellite destruction that has yet to be put entirely right. Oh, and an unauthorised fusion explosion. Middle of nowhere, granted, but still. None of this, happily, within my jurisdiction, but trouble does appear to be rather following you around, human Taak, and here you are in my city.’ The Administrator rolled fractionally towards Fassin’s gascraft. ‘Thinking of staying long?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well—’ Fassin began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The human is under my protection, Administrator!’ Y’sul interrupted. ‘I vouch for it entirely and will continue to accept all kudos consequences regarding its actions. I shall take all steps necessary to safeguard it from whatever hostile forces may wish it ill. May I count on your support for the expedition the human insists on making into the war zone?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Given,’ the Administrator said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How splendid! We can be ready to leave within a couple of days. Especially if the tailor Deystelmin is persuaded to prioritise my combat-clothing order.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll have a word.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Too kind! I swear I shall never nominate you for a coercive vote again!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My gratitude knows no bounds.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">If Dwellers could grit their teeth, Fassin thought, the Administrator’s words would have been spoken through them. ‘Excuse me, ma’am,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, human Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Have you any word on events elsewhere in the system?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘As I say, the various rings and moons are shifting fractionally in their orbits to accommodate—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think he means the stellar system, not that of Nasqueron,’ Colonel Hatherence said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The two Dwellers turned to look at her. Dwellers had sensing bands all the way round their outer rims, plus eye bubbles low on their outer hubs. They were not known as the best glarers in the galaxy but they were always willing to give it their best shot. To a Dweller, their own planet was pretty much everything. Most gas-giants had many more moons than the average stellar system possessed planets, and most radiated a lot more energy than they received from the star they orbited, their heat-transfer systems, weather and ecology arising largely from processes internal to the planet itself, not dependent on sunlight. Their inhabitants had to pay close attention to the skies, basically to watch out for incoming, but even that consideration led to an obviously gas-giant-centred way of thinking. The local star and the rest of its planetary system was of relatively little interest to the average Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That is not quite what I meant,’ Fassin told them quickly. ‘The moon ’glantine, for example; has it been harmed?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not to my knowledge,’ the Administrator said, with another stern look at Hatherence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And the military ships that were in orbit around Third Fury?’ the colonel asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">(- Shh! Fassin signalled Hatherence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No! she sent back.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What ships?’ the Administrator said, apparently mystified.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How about the planet Sepekte?’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I have no idea,’ the Administrator told him. She fixed her gaze on Fassin. ‘Is this why you wished to see me? To ask after the welfare of moons and distant planets?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, ma’am. The reason that I wanted to see you is that I am worried that there may be a threat to Nasqueron.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You are?’ blurted Y’sul.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Really?’ the Administrator said with a sigh.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even Hatherence was turned to look at him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There is a war beginning amongst the Quick, ma’am,’ Fassin told the Administrator. ‘It is going to come to Ulubis and it is not impossible that some of the forces taking part may wish to involve Nasqueron and its Dwellers in that war in some way.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Administrator rolled fractionally back and sucked her outer trim-frill in, the Dweller equivalent of a frown.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">(- Major? the colonel sent. - You said nothing of this. What do you base this on? Is there something you’re not telling me?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A hunch. Just trying to get their attention. And I should point out that it’s considered impolite to signal-whisper like this.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Administrator continued to look at Fassin for a moment, then turned to Y’sul. ‘Is this human normally mad?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul made a sucking sound. ‘Down to definitions.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Nasqueron might be vulnerable to a further bombardment, ’ Fassin persisted. ‘Even to some sort of raid.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ha!’ Y’sul laughed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are not defenceless, human Taak!’ the Administrator said loudly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">No, but your spaceships are leaky antiques and your planetary defences are set up for dumb rocks</span>, Fassin thought wearily. <span class="italic">You talk a good defence, but if the Epiphany 5</span>
<span class="italic">invaders decide to attack, or the Mercatoria decides I’m dead and they plump for a more obvious way to get hold of whatever might be in Valseir’s library, you won’t be able to do much to stop them. Going on what I’ve seen, a single Navarchy Military destroyer could lay waste to your whole planet, over time</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course not,’ he agreed. ‘But I would ask you to pass this information on to the relevant authorities. You will be still better defended if you are prepared.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll bear that in mind,’ the Administrator told him levelly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh shit</span>, Fassin thought. <span class="italic">You’re going to do fuck all. You aren’t going to bother telling anybody</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul was looking up. ‘What’s that?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin experienced a moment of horror. He looked up too. A stubby vaned cylinder a couple of metres high was hovering vertically above them in the darkness outside the ceiling’s still-open diamond petals. It was pointing something long and dark at them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Administrator groaned. ‘Oh no,’ she said. ‘That is the press.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Sholish! My <span class="italic">good</span> cuirass, you witless rind-nibbling waste of gas!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul threw a piece of armour across the room at his servant. The camo-painted carbon plate spun through the gas, changing colours rapidly as it tried to adapt, narrowly missed several other Dwellers - the large room was crowded and people had to duck, bob or dodge - just avoided Sholish and embedded itself in a FloatTree panel, producing a distinct thunk. Before it had much of a chance to blend in, Sholish tugged it out of the wall and disappeared into a side chamber, muttering.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Excuse me,’ Colonel Hatherence said sharply to a Dweller who’d just bumped into her in the general shuffling that had spread through the room to give the thrown piece of armour a clear trajectory.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Excused!’ the Dweller said, then continued his conversation with another of Y’sul’s relations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul was getting ready to quit Hauskip and leave for the war along with his charges, Fassin and the oerileithe. His new combat clothing had arrived just that morning (kudos-enhancingly quickly!) along with various gifts from friends and family, most of whom, it seemed, had thought it best to show up in person to present their mostly useless or positively dangerous gifts and offer vast amounts of generally contradictory but extremely loudly proffered advice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul, flattered and excited to be the centre of so much attention, had invited them all into his dressing room for snacks and whatever while he tried on all his new clothing, checked that his antique, inherited familial armour still more or less fitted and played with all the new bits and pieces he’d been given. Fassin counted over thirty Dwellers in the chamber, which was one of the larger spaces in the wheel-shaped house. There was a saying to the effect that one Dweller constituted an argument-in-waiting, two a conspiracy and three a riot. Quite what a gathering of thirty-plus was supposed to represent he wasn’t sure, but it would assuredly have nothing to do with silence or subtlety. The noise rang off the curved walls. The clothing competed for loudness. Expressive patterns spread across exposed carapace skin like flip-books of geometric artwork. Magnetic chatter swirled, infrasound bounced confusion from one wall to another and a heady mix of pheromones bathed the place in frantic currents of Dweller hilarity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Are there other guides-cum-guards we might employ beside this one? Hatherence asked, pressing up to the wall beneath where Fassin floated as another Dweller bearing gifts arrived and pushed his way through the throng towards Y’sul.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not really, Fassin told her. - Y’sul suffered a significant kudos-loss within the Guard-mentors Guild taking on an alien outworlder, back when he agreed to be Uncle Slovius’s mentor. He got that back eventually but it was a brave thing to do. Few of them will accept that kind of loss. Starting from scratch to find somebody new would take years, even if Y’sul did agree.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something small, round, pink and gooey bumped into the top of the colonel’s esuit, and stuck. She batted it away. - What <span class="italic">are</span> all these things? she said, exasperated.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Just hospitality, Fassin sent, with a resigned expression.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Floating, drifting round the room were bobfruits, floss-balls, chandelier-gumbushes and wobbling breezetrays loaded with sweetmeats, mood-balloons, narcopastes and party-suppositories. The guests helped themselves, eating, ingesting, snorting, rubbing and inserting away as appropriate. The noise seemed to be swelling by the minute, as was the collision rate - always a sure indicator that Dwellers were getting out of it (lots of loud bumps, hasty cries of ‘Excuse me!’, sudden, alarming tiltings, and bursts of the sort of especially raucous laughter which invariably accompanied the realisation by a Dweller that one of its companions had lost control of their buoyancy).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh dear, Fassin said. - I do believe this is turning into a party.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Are these people <span class="italic">intoxicated</span>? Hatherence asked, sounding genuinely shocked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at her, letting his incredulity show. - Colonel, he told her, - they are rarely anything else.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was a bang and a yelp from somewhere near where Y’sul floated. A bobfruit exploded in mid-gas and fell limply to the floor. People nearby wiped foamy pieces of fruit off their clothes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oops!’ Y’sul said, amidst widespread laughter.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- He can’t be the only guide! the colonel protested. - What about other Seers? They must have guides too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- They do, but it’s a one-to-one thing, an exclusive relationship. Abandoning your Guard-mentor would be a terrible insult. They’d lose all kudos.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Major Taak, we cannot afford to be sentimental here! If there is even a possibility that we might find a better, less idiotic guide, we ought at least to start looking.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The Guard-mentors are a Guild, colonel. They run a closed shop. If you dumped one of them, none of the rest would touch you. You’d certainly then find some clown who’d offer to act as a guide, mentor, guard, whatever - in fact they’d probably have to form a queue - but they’d be very young and stupid, or very old and, ah, eccentric, and they’d assuredly get you into far more trouble than they were ever likely to get you out of. The Guard-mentors Guild would harass them from the start, for one thing, and the vast majority of other Dwellers wouldn’t talk to you at all. Librarians, archive-keepers, antiquarians, exo-specialists - all the people we most need to talk to, in other words - in particular would not even give you the time of day.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They made room for Y’sul’s servant, Sholish, returning from the side chamber with a two-piece, highly polished, mirror-finished cuirass. Sholish was an adolescent, only a few hundred years old, barely three-quarters grown and skinny. Personal servants, always at least two generational stages younger than their masters, were fairly common in Dweller society, especially where the senior Dweller was bothering to pursue a hobby-cum-profession which actually involved a degree of study and/or training, when the servant had a fighting chance of picking up the basics of the given trade. The better masters regarded their servants more as apprentices than servants and the occasional especially aberrant ones treated their underlings almost as equals.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul had yet to fall prey to such sentimentality.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And about time, you custard-brained phlegm-wart!’ Y’sul yelled, snatching the cuirass from Sholish’s grasp. ‘Did you have to forge and weave the armour yourself? Or did you start gazing at your own reflection and lose all track?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sholish mumbled, retreated.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I refuse to accept that we are as powerless as you imply, major, the colonel told Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He turned to look at the oerileithe. - We are here very much on sufferance, colonel. The Dwellers can go off entire species of Seers, for no accountable reason. Nobody’s ever worked out a pattern to this. You just suddenly find that you and your kind aren’t welcome any more. It doesn’t usually happen while they’re still getting to know a new-to-civilisation species, but even that’s no guarantee. They certainly get fed up with individuals - I’ve seen it happen - and that’s equally random. Every time I come down here I have to accept that no matter how friendly and helpful everybody might have been during my last visit - (the colonel gave a sceptical laugh) - they might have nothing more to do with me this time or ever again. In fact, they might tell me I’ve got a day to get out or become the object of a hunt. And a Seer faces that prospect every single time they delve, either remotely or directly. We just have to get used to it. They don’t even need to have met you; there are records of Seers-to-be who’ve spent decades getting trained up, who’ve been part of respected Seer Septs going back millennia who’ve been about to go on their very first delve and been told not to bother and to stay away for ever. It’s a minor miracle they’ve accepted you the way they have. And don’t forget the only reason you’re not constantly being challenged as an interloper is because Y’sul is on record as vouching for you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You are saying we are stuck with this buffoon.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We are. I know it’s hard to believe, but he’s one of the better ones.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Core help us. Why waste time? I shall apply for my posthumous decoration immediately.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Volunteer Guild of Guard-mentors existed to look after Dwellers visiting from other bands of the same planet, or, very rarely, from another gas-giant, usually one within the same stellar system. Dwellers - almost always alone - did make journeys from one stellar system to another, but it didn’t happen often and it usually meant that the individual concerned had been thrown out of their own home gas-giant for some particularly heinous crime or unforgivable character defect.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dwellers had pretty much stopped making deep space trips en masse after the Second Diasporian Age, when the galaxy had been half the age it was now. It was generally held that seven billion years’ lack of practice probably accounted for the sheer awfulness of Dweller spaceship design and building standards, though Fassin wasn’t convinced that cause and effect hadn’t been confused here.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were due to leave for the war zone the following day. The interval since the frustrating audience with the City Administrator had been spent fending off Dweller journalists and their news remotes and trying to find out what they could about events in the wider system. Eventually they’d had to compromise and trade. One journalist got a very guarded but exclusive interview from Fassin (very guarded indeed - Colonel Hatherence kept coughing loudly whenever they approached any subject remotely to do with their mission) in return for news of the outside.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Third Fury moon had been devastated and all on or in it had perished. There was no news of a drop ship surviving, though equally there was no news of any wreckage from such a ship being found. However, of course, if it had just dropped into the Depths . . . Many satellites had been destroyed or damaged. Those belonging to the Quick (this meant the Mercatoria) appeared to be either missing or out of action. Some warships belonging to the current local Quick species had spent an amount of time investigating the rubble of the moon Third Fury. The moon ’glantine appeared much as it always had. Stellar-system ship traffic appeared light, as it had for some days now, but not anomalous. A signal had been sent on the behalf of Oculan Colonel Hatherence, on the authority of Guard-mentor Y’sul of Hauskip, to the moon ’glantine. No reply had yet been received. Nothing untoward had happened to the transmitting station responsible following the transmission.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">According to the journalist, this was all stuff they could have found out themselves, eventually. The trick was knowing where to look. The journalist seemed to feel miffed that they’d got the better end of the deal, too, because everything he’d told them was at least ninety per cent true, specifically to avoid upsetting them. He knew aliens could be funny that way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘What, exactly, did your friend say?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He said they wanted him to . . . “to gas-line a whole bunch of stuff for . . .” I’m pretty certain those were his exact words. Then he seemed to realise he was saying too much, giving too much away, and he changed the subject. The . . . hesitation, that sudden change of subject made the earlier form of words all the more important. He realised he was speaking to somebody who spent a lot of his life in Nasqueron, who might not feel the same way he would about the implications of what he was talking about.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This was spoken in . . .?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Humanised G-Clear, very close to this. Meanings are pretty much identical, just altered pronunciation for the human voice.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No Anglish words involved?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘None.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, he said “gas-lined” not “streamlined” or “air-lined”?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One wouldn’t say “air-lined” as far as I know. The normal form of words would be “streamlined”. He chose “gas-lined” without thinking because it was more technically correct, because it has a narrower meaning. In this context it means altering a vacuum-capable craft so that it can also operate in an atmosphere like Nasqueron’s.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Which you take to mean that an invasion or large-scale destructive raid upon us is imminent?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think some sort of raid is a distinct possibility.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This seems a thin thread to hang such a weighty fear upon.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know. But please understand, the guy’s company builds and refits three-quarters of the system’s war craft. The phrase “gas-lined” is quite specific and that sudden change of tack when he realised he was talking to somebody who might be sentimentally or emotionally attached to Nasqueron and sympathetic towards Dwellers is significant. I know this man, I’ve known him since I was a child. I know how his mind works.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Attempting to invade a gas-giant would, nevertheless, be a momentous action. In seven thousand years, the Mercatoria has done no such thing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The situation is desperate for them locally. They are under threat of invasion within the year. A standard year, not one of yours. Help is at least one more standard year away beyond that. In fact, the invasion may already be beginning. The attacks on Third Fury and the Mercatoria’s other assets around Nasq. could be part of it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And attempting to invade us helps them how?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They think there may be something here which will make a difference. Some information. That’s why I’m here, to look for it. But if they thought I was dead or not likely to succeed, the Mercatoria might intervene directly. Plus the invaders the Mercatoria is worried about might well think the same way with even less cause to hesitate. I get the impression the future continuance of Dweller Studies is kind of low on their set of priorities.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fassin, what sort of information could possibly make such a course of action seem sensible?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Important information.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘More specifically?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Very important information.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You are not willing to tell me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Willing or able. Best you don’t know.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So you tell me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If I thought the specifics would help convince you, I’d let you know,’ Fassin lied.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was talking to a Dweller called Setstyin. Setstyin liked to call himself an influence pedlar, which was a humble term for somebody with contacts extending as high as his went. Dweller society was remarkably flat in terms of social hierarchy - flat as the surface of a neutron star compared to the sheer verticality of the Mercatoria’s baroque monstrosity - but to the extent that there was a top and bottom of society, the suhrl Setstyin was in touch with both.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was a society host and a part-time social worker, a hospital visitor and a friend to the great and good as far as either could be said to exist in Dweller terms; a sociable, clubbable creature intensely and genuinely interested in other people, more so even than in kudos (this made him very unusual, even strange, almost threatening). He was, in human terms, somewhere between a total geek and very cool. His geekiness was that bizarre failure to care about the one thing that everybody agreed really mattered: kudos, while his coolness came from the same source, because not caring about kudos - not obsessing about it, not chasing it down wherever it might be found, not constantly measuring one’s own coolness against that of one’s peers - was in itself kind of cool. As long as there was not the faintest shadow of a suspicion he was playing some weird back-game, deliberately pursuing kudos by pretending not to, so long as his lack of interest in it was seen as being the unaffected carelessness of a kind of wise naïf, he was kudos-rich, though in a curiously unenviable way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">(It had been Slovius who had first explained to Fassin how kudos worked. Fassin had thought it was a bit like money. Slovius had explained that even money wasn’t like money used to be, but anyway kudos was sometimes almost an opposite. The harder you’d worked for your kudos, the less it was worth.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin was also one of the most sensible, level-minded Dwellers Fassin had ever encountered. And he treated a request by a mere human to wake up, speed up and converse over the phone with a degree of respect and seriousness that few other Dwellers would have.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had told Hatherence he needed time to let his human brain and body sleep, and his arrowcraft self-repair and recharge itself. He’d retreated to the long spoke room he’d been allocated in Y’sul’s house. This was a dark and dusty gallery littered with piles of discarded clothes, lined with ancient wardrobes and floored with out-of-favour paintings and crumpled wall hangings. There was a double-dent Dweller bed in there too and a treefoam-lined cubby by one wall, so it kind of constituted a bedroom, not that Fassin or his gascraft really needed such a thing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had secured the door, used the little arrowcraft’s sonic senses to locate a removable ceiling panel and exited through the double skin roof into a breezy and relatively dark night.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Like all Dweller cities, Hauskip was situated in a historically calm patch within its atmospheric volume, but cities still had weather. They experienced pressure differentials, squalls, fog, rain, snow, crosswinds, upwellings, down draughts, lateral force and spin, all depending on the state of the gas stream around them. Moderately buffeted, half-hidden by the shreds of thicker gas scudding across the lamplit night, Fassin had made his way up and out across the sheen of rooftops.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sky traffic had been relatively light - most travel would be within the spindles and spokes linking the city’s main components - but there had been a few Dwellers roting about in the distance, and enough small craft - packet-delivery machines, mostly - for Fassin to hope he was going unremarked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Distant lightning had flickered deep below.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had come to a dangling wave-guide cable a few centimetres thick, followed it up to a deserted public plaza like a vast, empty bowl circled with dim, attenuated lights, and found a public screen booth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin was also in the equatorial band, though on the other side of the planet. Fassin might therefore have hoped to find him awake at such a time, but Setstyin had been sleeping off the effects of an especially good party he’d hosted the night before. Dwellers could go for tens of their days without sleep but when they did sleep they tended to do so on a prodigious scale. Fassin had begged and pleaded with Setstyin’s servant to have him woken and even then it had taken a while. Setstyin looked and sounded groggy, but it appeared that his mind was fully awake inside there somewhere.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And you would like me to do what?’ Setstyin asked. He scratched at his gill fringe with one spindle arm. He was wearing a light sleep collar round his mid-hub, which was regarded as a polite minimum when addressing someone other than a close friend or family member over the phone. Dwellers were hardly self-conscious about showing their inner-hub mouth parts and pleasure organs, but there was a degree of decorum in such matters, especially when confronted with an alien. ‘What shall I say, Fassin, and to whom?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A gust of wind made the arrowcraft’s vanes purr to hold it in place as Fassin looked into the camerascreen. ‘Convince whoever you can, preferably as high as you can reach, preferably discreetly, that there really is a threat. Give them time to decide what they’re going to do if there is a raid. It may be best just to let it happen. What you don’t want to do is have an unthinking hostile reaction that leads to some maniac Quick nuking a city or two to try to teach you a lesson.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin looked confused. ‘How would that benefit anybody?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Please, just trust me - it’s the sort of thing Quick species do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You want me to talk to politicians and military people, then, yes?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’ Politicians and military people in Dweller society were as much amateurs and dilettantes as gifted tailors or devout party-throwers like Setstyin - possibly a little less dedicated - but you had, Fassin reflected, to work with what you were presented with.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin looked thoughtful. ‘They’re not going to go with an invasion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This was true, Fassin supposed. In the full sense of the word an invasion was impossible. The Ulubis forces were hopelessly inadequate for the task of occupying a volume as great as Nasqueron or any other gas-giant, even if it had been inhabited by a congenitally peaceful, naturally subservient and easily cowed species rather than, well, Dwellers. Attempting to control the place with Dwellers around would be like peeing into a star. The danger was that, in carrying out a raid to secure a given volume for long enough to hunt down the information they were looking for, the Mercatoria would cause the Dwellers to react as though they were undergoing a full-scale invasion. It seemed to be part of Dweller psychology that if something was worth reacting to, it was even more worth overreacting to, and Fassin dreaded to think what that might imply for all sides.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Stress an extended raid and temporary site occupation with aggressive patrols that might be mistaken for an invasion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Whereabouts?’ Setstyin asked. ‘Or are you really going to tell me you have no idea?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I understand we’re going to be looking in or very near the new Formal War zone.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin let his hub arms droop down at his side. This was something like a human rolling their eyes. ‘Well, of course, where else?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t suppose there’s the slightest possibility that the war might be cancelled or postponed?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There is always a chance, but it certainly won’t have anything to do with a mere party animal like myself having a word in even the highest-placed ear. Think: there might be the possibility of genuine hostile action against us, an act of alien aggression within the winds of Nasqueron itself and the suggestion is we call <span class="italic">off</span> a Formal War? More likely we’ll start a few more to show how jolly fierce we are and get some practice in.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just thought I’d ask.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘When do you set off for the war zone?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Tomorrow morning, Hauskip local time.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There you are. In plenty of time for the war’s opening ceremony.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I may have other things on my mind.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm. You realise that me having a word on high may well result in you being tracked, watched by interested parties?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Whereas that would never happen normally? But yes, I realise that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, I wish you well, Fassin Taak.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thanks.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin peered at the camerascreen, looking at Fassin’s surroundings. ‘Y’sul out of kudos with the phone operators?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I have an additional Guard-mentor in the shape of an oerileithe Mercatoria military colonel. She might not understand my concern. I sneaked out to make the call.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Very cloak, very dagger. Good luck with your quest, Fassin. Do keep in touch.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘If you’re watching this, Sal, then I’m dead. Obviously I don’t know what the circumstances of that death may have been. Like to think I died bravely and honourably in combat. Kind of don’t think you’ll be watching this because my clogs were popped peacefully in my sleep because I don’t mean for that to happen, at least not until something’s happened that involves you. Dying peacefully . . . actually, hopefully, that would mean you’re already dead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The thing that involves you sort of involves Fass, too, though not in the same way. Involves you and me and Fass and Ilen. Poor dead Ilen. Ilen Deste, Sal. You remember her? Maybe you don’t. It’s been so long, for all of us, for all these strange different reasons that end up being just the same. You with your treatments, Fass with his slowtime, me all Einsteined out with too much time near light speed. Time hasn’t ever caught up with any of us, has it, Sal?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But I’m thinking you probably do remember Ilen and what happened to her, because it was all so traumatic for us, wasn’t it? You don’t forget anything about something that dramatic and horrible, not really. How can you? You have nightmares about it, it sneaks up on you even in the day sometimes, too. Do you find that? I get that. Sometimes it’s something really obvious, like seeing something on screen of somebody hanging by their fingertips over a drop, especially if it’s a woman. Of course in the screen they usually get rescued. Not always, but usually. But then other times what happened just . . . ambushed me. I’ll be doing something completely normal, with no . . . cues, no . . . stimulus that you can see any logical reason would trigger the memories, and suddenly I’m there, I’m back again, back in that big old motherfucker of a ship, with you and Fass and Ilen.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Do</span> you get that? I get it still, even after all these years. You’d have thought it would have stopped happening by now, wouldn’t you? Hell, even without all those stolen years near <span class="italic">c</span>, you’d have thought it should have, you know, withered, fallen away? Look at me; sixty-one years old, body-time, they tell me. Fitter than ever, still bedding guys a third my age, and - do I look sixty? Hope not. But I should have got over the whole thing by now, don’t you think? Time a great healer and all that. Just hasn’t happened.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, <span class="italic">do</span> you get anything similar? Is this ringing any bells at all? Really, I’d like to know. Maybe we’ll find out, one day. Maybe I’ll have got to ask this and you’ll never get to see this but we’ll have found out together. Maybe somebody else will get to see this. It isn’t really meant for anybody else, but, well, this is a high-risk occupation, and who knows what’ll happen after this is made?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Anyway, point is: I know what happened, and I intend to kill you, Sal. Or, I did. As I say, if it is you who’s watching this, I’m dead and you’re still alive. But I want you to know it isn’t going to end there. Got serious intentions of pursuing you from beyond the grave, Sal, old son. Won’t be easy, realise that, but I’ve spent my entire career getting myself into a position of power. Making myself so powerful within the Navy that I can click my fingers and battleships power up, set course and ship out. Building networks, making friends, finding allies, taking lovers, taking exams, running risks, all so that I’ll have the power one day to challenge a man who, oh, must nearly own the system by now. The portal collapse nearly threw me - put my plans back a long way - but I reckon you’ll still be alive and loving life when I finally do get home, or when what’s planned to happen in the event of my death starts happening.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Can’t tell you too much, obviously. No reason to give you any sort of warning at all. And all the advantages are on your side already, aren’t they? Well, maybe apart from surprise. You surprised now? If you’re listening to this, watching this? Wondering what’s going to happen?? Well, wonder away. Wonder away, Sal, and don’t stop wondering, don’t stop being frightened, because being frightened might keep you alive a bit longer. Not too long. Definitely not too long, but long enough.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I suppose that’s enough now, don’t you think? Definitely the longest speech either of us ever delivered even while we were together, way back when, wouldn’t you say? Maybe almost more than we ever said to each other put together. Well, almost.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Let me explain, in case you still haven’t got it: I saw the marks, Sal. I saw the three red lines on your neck, before you put your jacket collar up. Remember that? Remember pretending to shiver and saying, “C-collar,” or whatever it was? Remember? Just one of those little false notes that you don’t notice at the time because of all the fear and adrenalin, that doesn’t start to nag at you until long afterwards. Kept that collar up afterwards, too, didn’t you? Kept the jacket on like some sort of comfort blanket until you could get to a bathroom and a first-aid kit, didn’t you? I remember. And when I was reaching down to Ilen, I saw her fingernails. With the blood under them. Saw them very distinctly. Fass didn’t; still has no idea, even yet. But I saw them. I wasn’t entirely sure about the marks on your neck, but then I checked. Remember that last farewell fuck, a couple of weeks later? Just checking. They were very faint by then, of course, but they were there all right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You always wanted her, didn’t you, Sal? Always so desired the beautiful Ilen. Did you think because she went into the ship with you she was saying yes? Did you? Did she, then changed her mind? Doesn’t really matter, I suppose. I saw what I saw.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You know what’s funny, too? I was there, even if you weren’t. Ilen and I. Just the once, but that’s something else I’ll never forget, either. Oh, you’d have loved to have been there for that, wouldn’t you? Bet you would. I slept with Fass, too, afterwards, just to complete the set. <span class="italic">Much</span> better than you, by the way.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The uniformed figure sat forward, right up to the camera, staring into it, voice going quiet and low.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was coming to get you, Sal. If you’re watching this then I didn’t make it, not personally, but even from beyond the grave, I’m still fucking coming to get you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The image froze, then faded. A hand, shaking only slightly, reached out and turned the viewer off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div>
