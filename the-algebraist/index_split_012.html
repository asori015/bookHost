<div class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">EVENTS DURING WARTIME</span></span></div><div class="calibre_9"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">It was a truism that there was not just one galaxy, there were many. Every variety of widely spread sentient life - plus a few creat categories which were arguably non-sentient though still capable of interstellar travel - and sometimes even every individual species-type tended to have one galaxy to itself. The Faring - a trans-category that covered all such beings able and willing to venture beyond their own immediate first-habitats - were like the citizens of a vast, fully three-dimensional but mostly empty city with multitudinous and varied travel systems. The majority of people were content to walk, and made their slow progress by way of an infinitude of quiet, effectively separate deserted streets, quiet parks, vacant lots, remains of wasteland and an entire unmapped network of paths, pavements, alleys, steps, ladders, wynds and snickets. They almost never encountered anybody en route, and when they got to where they were going, it would be somewhere very similar to the place they had departed from, whether that place had been a star’s photosphere, a brown dwarf’s surface, a gas-giant’s atmosphere, a comet cloud or a region of interstellar space. Such species were generally called the Slow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Quick were different. Mostly originating from rocky planets of one sort or another, they lived at a higher speed and could never be content forever plodding from place to place. That they had been forced to do so until a viable wormhole network had been established was regarded as quite bad enough. Wormhole access portals were the pinch-points of the wormhole system - the city’s underground stations - where people of varying species-types were forced to meet and to some extent mingle, though given the tiny amount of time one spent near a portal or within a wormhole, even this seemingly profound tying-together made very little difference to the ultimate unconnectedness of the many different life-strands, and both before they gathered and after they dispersed, the users of the system still tended to congregate at places specific to their own comfort criteria, usually quite different from those of all the others.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Many people regarded the Cincturia as the equivalent of animals: birds, dogs, cats, rats and bacteria. They too lived in the city, but were not responsible for it or entirely answerable to it, and were often to a greater or lesser degree inimical to its smooth running.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Accounting for the Rest - the non-baryonic Penumbrae, the 13-D Dimensionates and the flux-dwelling Quantarchs - was a little like discovering that the ground, the fabric of the city’s buildings and their foundations plus the air itself were each home to another sort of life altogether.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Mercatoria - largely but not entirely made up the galaxy’s current crop of oxygen breathers - inhabited its own galaxy, then, as did all the other categories of life, and all these different galaxies existed alongside every other one, each interpenetrating the rest, surrounded by and surrounding the others, yet hardly affecting or being affected by them, except, sometimes, through the inestimably precious and all too easily destroyed wormhole network.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Us? Oh, we were like ghosts in the cabling.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Slave-children were crawling along the giant blades of one of the Dreadnought’s main propellers, packing welding gear, back-sacks of carbon weave and heavy glue-throwers. The pulsing drone of the vessel’s engines and main propulsion thrummed through the wrap-cloak of brown, billowing mist, filling the slipstreamed gas and the structure of the huge ship with buzzing, building, rising and fading harmonics like a vast unending symphony of industrial sound.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin and the colonel watched from an open gantry overlooking the ring of giant engines as the two teams of Dweller infants crawled along the massive blades to the warped and flapping blade ends.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The starboard-most propeller had been hit by a section of DewCloud root. The root had fallen out of the clouds above, probably from a dying DewCloud floating and decomposing tens of kilometres above. DewClouds were enormous, foamy plants anything up to ten kilometres across and five or six times that in height. Like all gas-giant flora, they were mostly gas - a Dweller in a hurry could probably rip right through the canopy of one, hardly noticing they were in the midst of a plant, not an ordinary cloud. To a human they looked like some monstrous cross between an elongated mushroom and a jellyfish the size of a thunder cloud. Part of an Ubiquitous clade, found wherever Dwellers were, they harvested water condensation out of Dwellerine gas-giant atmospheres, using their dangling, thick and relatively solid roots to exploit the temperature difference between the various atmospheric layers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When they approached the ends of their lives they floated up to the cold cloud tops and the higher haze layers, and bits broke off. The Dreadnought had prop guards to stop floating /falling/rising stuff interfering with its main propulsion units, but the section of root had slipped in between the guard and the propeller itself, wreaking brief havoc with the thirty-metre-long vanes before being chewed up and thrown out. Now the child-slaves had to climb out along the blades, from the hubs to the tips, to make repairs. Shaped like slim deltas with thin, delicate-looking tentacles which had to both clamp them on to the still-revolving blades and hold the various repair materials, the infants were making heavy weather of it. Dweller officers in motor skiffs rode nearby, bellowing orders, threats and imprecations at the young.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They could just stop the fucking propeller,’ the colonel shouted to Fassin. The open gantry they were holding on to was four-fifths of the way back from the bulbous nose of the giant ship, an ellipsoid a little over two kilometres in length and four hundred across the beam. The Dreadnought’s twenty-four giant engine-sets protruded from near its rear in a monumental collar of pylons, wires, tubular prop guards and near-spherical engine pods. The wind howled round Hatherence’s esuit and Fassin’s little arrowcraft.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Slow them down too much, apparently!’ Fassin yelled back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dreadnought’s captain had cut the starboard-most engine-set to quarter-power to give the slave-children a better chance of completing their repairs without too many casualties. The ship’s giant rudders, mounted on the octiform tailplane assembly just aft of the engines, were appropriately deployed to compensate for the resulting skewed distribution of thrust.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin glimpsed an escort cruiser through a short-lived break in the clouds a few kilometres away. Other Dreadnoughts and their escorting screens of minor craft were spread out around them in a front a hundred kilometres across and thirty deep. A slave-child near one of the vane tips lost its grip and whirled off the end with a distant shriek, crashing into the inner edge of the outer prop guard. Its scream cut off and the limp body was caught in the combined prop wash and sent whirling back, narrowly avoiding a further collision with the tail assembly. It disappeared behind a giant vertical fin. When it came back into sight it was already starting to spiral slowly down into the enveloping cloud haze. None of the skiff-riding Dwellers spared it a second glance. The dozens of remaining slave-children continued to inch their way along the giant blades.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at the colonel. ‘Woops,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were hitching a ride to the war zone.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>A TunnelCar had taken them from Y’sul’s house - well, two TunnelCars, a second proving necessary to carry all Y’sul’s baggage and extra clothing, plus Sholish - to the Central Station. From there they joined a long-distance train of ninety or so cars making its way towards the border of Zone Zero - the equatorial zone - and Band A, twenty thousand kilometres away. Y’sul spent a large part of the journey complaining about his hangover.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You claim to have been around in your present form for ten billion years and you still haven’t developed a decent <span class="italic">hangover</span> cure?’ Hatherence had asked, incredulous.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d been floating in a restaurant car, waiting for the galley to figure out the exact chemical composition of oerileithe food.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul, his voice muffled, issuing from within a translucent coverall that was the Dweller equivalent of dark glasses, had replied, ‘Suffering is regarded as part of the process, as is the mentioning of it. As is, one might add, the sympathy one receives from one’s companions.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel had looked sceptical. ‘I thought you felt no pain?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mere physical pain, no. Ours is the psychic pain of realising that the world is not really as splendid as it seemed the evening before, and that one may have made something of a fool of oneself. And so on. I wouldn’t expect a little dweller to understand.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d detrained at Nuersotse, a sphere city riding mid-altitude in the boiling ragged fringes of the equatorial Belt’s northern limits. Nuersotse was barely thirty kilometres in diameter, relatively dense by Dweller city standards and built for strength and manoeuvrability. High-speed transport craft left in convoys every hour or so, as one of the Band Border Wheels swung near.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d crossed on the Nuersotsian-Guephuthen Band Border Wheel One, a colossal, articulated structure two thousand kilometres across held rotating on the border of two atmospheric gas-giant bands, protruding a kilo-klick into each, its whole enormous mass spun by the contra-rotating gas-streams on either side. Band Border Wheels were the largest moving structures most gas-giant planets possessed, if one discounted the globe-girdling CloudTunnel networks. These only moved in the trivial sense of being whisked round the globe at a few hundred klicks an hour like everything else within a planetary band. To a Dweller that was stationary.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Band Border Wheels really <span class="italic">spun</span>, transferring transport and materials from one band to another with minimal turbulence and in relative safety, with the added bonus that they produced prodigious amounts of electricity from their spindle drive-shafts. These protruded from the upper and lower hubs, vast hemispheres whose lower rims were pocked with microwave dishes hundreds of metres across, geared up to tear round at blurring, mind-numbing speeds and beaming their power to an outer collecting ring of equally enormous stationary dishes which then pumped the energy into docked bulk accumulator carriers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Wheel and the city had been caught in the outer edges of a small boundary-riding storm when they’d arrived, though both were being moved out of the way as quickly as they could be. Everything, from the planet itself to Fassin’s teeth, had seemed to vibrate around them as the turbulence-hardened transfer ship hurried them empodded from the CloudTunnel station to the Wheel, engines labouring, wind screaming, ammonia hail pelting, lightning flashing and magnetic fields making various parts of Y’sul’s baggage and accoutrements buzz and fizz and spark.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hurled round in the giant centrifuge of the Wheel, stuck against its inner perimeter, the time that they’d spent inside had seemed almost calm by comparison, even allowing for the wild, wavelike bucking as they’d crossed the zone/belt border shear-face itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The storm had been affecting Guephuthe more severely than Nuersotse. The outer equatorial ring of the city was spinning hard, parts of its peripheral suburbs and less well-maintained districts coming apart and peeling away in a welter of thrown-out shrapnel. Their transfer had to buck and weave to dodge the wreckage, then take them straight to a TunnelCar marshalling yard beyond the city proper, a splay of cable filaments waving slowly in the gale like a vast anemone.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another multi-kiloklick CloudTunnel journey through the vastness of Belt A, the Northern Tropical, another Wheel transfer - calmer this time - into Zone 2, and finally, crossing the mid-line of the Zone, they’d started to encounter more military traffic than civilian, the cars and trains packed with people, supplies and matériel all heading for the war.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">At Tolimundarni, on the fringe of the war zone itself, they’d been thrown off the train by military police who weren’t falling for Y’sul’s pre-emptively outrage-fuelled arguments regarding the summit-like priority and blatant extreme officiality of an expedition - nay, a quest! - he was undertaking with these - yes, these, two - famous, well-connected, honoured alien guests of immeasurably high intrinsic pan-systemic cross-species reputation, concerning a matter of the utmost import the exact details of which he was sadly not at liberty to divulge even to such patently important and obviously discreet members of the armed forces as themselves, but who would, nevertheless, he was sure, entirely understand the significance of their mission and thus their clear right to be accorded unhindered passage due to simple good taste and a fine appreciation of natural justice and would in no way be swayed by the fact that their cooperation would be repaid in levels of subsequent kudos almost beyond crediting . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d floated in the TunnelBud, watching the train of cars pulling out. Sholish had darted around the echoing space trying to round up all the floating and fallen pieces of just-ejected luggage.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin and Hatherence had looked, glowering, at Y’sul.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d finished dusting himself down and straightening his clothing, then done a double take at their aggregated gaze and announced, defensively, ‘I have a cousin!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The cousin was an engineering officer on the Dreadnought <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>, a thirty-turreter with the BeltRotationeers’ 487th ‘Rolling Thunder’ Fleet. Bindiche, the cousin, bore a longstanding familial grudge against Y’sul and so naturally had been only too happy to accept a great deal of kudos from an inwardly mortified, outwardly brave-facing, hail-cuz-bygones-now Y’sul by doing him the enormous, surely never-to-be-forgotten favour of vouching for him and his alien companions to his captain and so securing passage into the war zone, though even that only happened after a quick suborb flight in a nominally freight-only moonshell pulsed from High Tolimundarni to Lopscotte (again covered by cousin Bindiche and his endlessly handy military connections, said vile spawn of a hated uncle amassing anguished Y’sul-donated kudos like the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>’s mighty capacitors accumulated charge), scudding over the cloud tops, briefly in space (but no windows, not even any screen to see it), listening to Y’sul complain about the uncannily hangover-resembling after-effects of the fierce acceleration in the magnetic-pulse tube and the fact that he’d had to leave behind most of his baggage, including all the war-zone presents his friends had given him and the bulk of the new combat attire he’d ordered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The slipstream howled and screamed around the Seer and the colonel. They watched the slave-children attempt their repairs. Clustered around the ends of the giant propeller blades, Fassin thought the Dweller young looked like a group of especially dogged flies clinging to a ceiling-mounted cooling fan.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dweller children had a generally feral and entirely unloved existence. It was very hard for humans not to feel that adult Dwellers were little better than serial, congenital abusers, and that Dweller children ought to be rescued from the relative brutality of their existence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even as Fassin watched, another infant was thrown from one of the giant blades, voice a high and anguished shriek. This latest unfortunate missed the prop guards but hit a high-tension stay cable and was almost cut in half. A Dweller in a skiff dipped back into the slipstream, wrestling with his craft, to draw level with the tiny, broken body. He stripped it of its welding kit and let the body go. It disappeared into the mist, falling like a torn leaf.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dwellers cheerfully admitted that they didn’t care for their children. They didn’t particularly care for becoming female and getting pregnant, frankly, doing this only because it was expected, drew kudos and meant one had in some sense fulfilled a duty. The idea of having to do even more, of having to look after the brats afterwards <span class="italic">as well</span> was just laughable. They, after all, had had to endure being thrown out of the house and left to wander wild when <span class="italic">they</span> were young, they’d taken their chances with the organised hunts, the gangs of adolescents and lone-hunter specialists, so why shouldn’t the next generation? The little fuckers might live for billions of years. What was a mere century of weeding out?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The slave-children being used to carry out the repairs to the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>’s damaged propeller would be regarded by most Dwellers as extremely lucky. They might be imprisoned and forced to carry out unpleasant and/or dangerous jobs but at least they were relatively safe, unhunted and properly fed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked out at them, wondering how many would survive to become adults. Would any of these skinny, trembling delta-shapes end up, billions of years from now, as utterly ancient, immensely respected Sages? The odd thing was, of course, that if you somehow knew for certain that they would, they wouldn’t believe you. Dweller children absolutely, to an infant, refused to believe even for a moment, even as a working assumption, even just for the sake of argument, that they would ever, ever, <span class="italic">ever</span> grow up to become one of these huge, fierce, horrible double-disc creatures who hunted them and killed them and captured them to do all the awful jobs on their big ships.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Seer Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes, colonel?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So they were back to close-communicating, using polarised light to keep their conversation as private as possible. The colonel had suggested coming up here. Fassin had wondered if it was for some private chat. He supposed ordinary talk might have been problematic, given the screech of the slipstream around the gantry and the thunderous clamour sounding from the choir of engines just behind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I have meant to ask for some time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- This thing we are supposed to be looking for. Without mentioning the specifics, even like this, using whisper-signalling . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Get on with it, colonel. Ma’am, he added.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do you believe what you told us, at that briefing on Third Fury? Hatherence asked. - The one with just yourself, Ganscerel, Yurnvic and myself present: could all that you told us there possibly be true?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Long Crossing, the fabled ’hole between galaxies, the List itself. - Does it matter? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What we believe always matters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin smiled. - Let me ask you something. May I?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- On the condition that we return to my question, very well.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do you believe in the ‘Truth’?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So capitalised?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So in quotation marks.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, of course!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Truth was the presumptuous name of the religion, the faith that lay behind the Shrievalty, the Cessoria, in a sense behind the Mercatoria itself. It arose from the belief that what appeared to be real life must in fact - according to some piously invoked statistical certitudes - be a simulation being run within some prodigious computational substrate in a greater and more encompassing reality beyond. This was a thought that had, in some form, crossed the minds of most people and all civilisations. (With the interesting exception of the Dwellers, or so they claimed. Which some parties held was another argument against them being a civilisation in the first place.) However, everybody - well, virtually everybody, obviously - quickly or eventually came round to the idea that a difference that made no difference wasn’t a difference to be much bothered about, and one might as well get on with (what appeared to be) life.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Truth went a stage further, holding that this was a difference that could be made to make a difference. What was necessary was for people truly to believe in their hearts, in their souls, in their minds, that they really were in a vast simulation. They had to reflect upon this, to keep it at the forefront of their thoughts at all times and they had to gather together on occasion, with all due ceremony and solemnity, to express this belief. And they must evangelise, they must convert everybody they possibly could to this view, because - and this was the whole point - once a sufficient proportion of the people within the simulation came to acknowledge that it was a simulation, the value of the simulation to those who had set it up would disappear and the whole thing would collapse.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">If they were all part of some vast experiment, then the fact that those on whom the experiment was being conducted had guessed the truth would mean that its value would be lost. If they were some plaything, then again, that they had guessed this meant they ought to be acknowledged, even - perhaps - rewarded. If they were being tested in some way, then this was the test being passed, this was a positive result, again possibly deserving a reward. If they had been undergoing punishment for some transgression in the greater world, then this ought to constitute cause for rehabilitation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was not possible to know what proportion of the simulated population would be required to bring things to a halt (it might be fifty per cent, it might be rather smaller or much greater), but as long as the numbers of the enlightened kept increasing, the universe would be constantly coming closer to this epiphany, and the revelation could come at any point.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Truth claimed with some degree of justification to be the ultimate religion, the final faith, the last of all churches. It was the one which encompassed all others, contextualised all others, could account for and embrace all others. They could all ultimately be dismissed as mere emergent phenomena of the simulation itself. The Truth could too, in a sense, but unlike them it still had more to say once this common denominator had been taken out of the equation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It could also claim a degree of universality that the others could not. All other major religions were either specific to their originating species, could be traced back to a single species - often a single subset of that species - or were consciously developed amalgams, syntheses, of a group of sufficiently similar religions of disparate origin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Truth, claiming no miracles (or at least no miracles of proof) and being the work of no individual, all-important prophet (it had arisen, naturally, many times within a multiplicity of different civilisations) was the first real post-scientific, pan-civilisational religion - or at least it was the first that had not been simply imposed on reluctant subjects by a conquering hegemony. The Truth could even claim to be not a religion at all, where such a claim might endear it to those not naturally religious by nature. It could be seen more as a philosophy, even as a scientific postulate backed up by unshakeably firm statistical likelihood.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Mercatoria had simply adopted this belief system, properly codified it and made it effectively the state religion of the latest Age.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You do not believe, Fassin? The colonel put sadness into her signal.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I appreciate the intellectual force of the argument.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- But it is not held in your mind at all times?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No. Sorry.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Be not sorry. We all find it difficult on occasion. We shall, perhaps, talk further on the matter.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I was afraid we might.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- To return to my question, then.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do I believe all that stuff?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Correct.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked around at the ship beneath them and the great assemblage of roaring engines, whirling blades and supporting structures. The Long Crossing: thirty million years between galaxies.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The idea that anything built by Dwellers could make a journey of that length does place the credulity under a degree of tension, he admitted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The assertion that the outward journey was made so much more rapidly seems no less to belong to the realm of fantasy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ah yes, the great and almost certainly mythical intergalactic ’hole.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I would not argue with you, colonel. Though I would say it’s perfectly possible that these are all nonsense, but the specific object we’re looking for still exists.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It keeps unlikely company.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Again, I wouldn’t choose to dispute the matter. We are left with the fact that you are a colonel, I am some sort of honorary major and orders are orders.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How assiduously one attempts to follow one’s orders might be affected by the extent to which one believes they are capable of being carried out successfully.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There I would completely agree with you. What are you getting at?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Just calibrating, major.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Seeing how committed I am? Would I sacrifice my life for our . . . object of desire?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Something like that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I suspect we’re both sceptics, colonel. Me more than you, I suppose. We also believe in doing our duty. You more than me, perhaps. Satisfied?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Content.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Me too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I received a communication from the Ocula this morning.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Really?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">And were you always going to tell me, or could I have been even more mission-sceptical during that last exchange, and been told nothing? Or has your ‘calibration’ meant I’m not going to get told everything now?</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes. Our orders remain as they were. There were several more attacks on the system in general at the time of the assault on the Third Fury moon. Further, less intense attacks have continued. The communications satellite system around Nasqueron is being repaired as a matter of urgency. In the meantime a Navarchy fleet is being stationed above the planet, to take the place of the satellites, to provide security and main force back-up for you and me, and to pick us up at the end of our mission, or in an emergency.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin took a moment to think.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Any word from my Sept, Sept Bantrabal?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- None. There was confirmation that all those on or in Third Fury were killed. I am sorry to report that Master Technician Hervil Apsile is also believed to be dead. There has been no sign of or communication with the drop ship. I have been asked by the Ocula to pass on their commiserations to you regarding all those deceased Seers and supporting staff, to which of course I add my own.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Thank you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel might have executed a sort of rolling bow, or it might just have been the effects of the swirling, buffeting slipstream tearing around them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The slave-children had suffered no further casualties. Their repairs appeared to be working. Even where they had not completed their renovations, the damaged blades were vibrating less, making the rest of the job easier.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How many ships were they sending to Nasqueron, to do all these things? <span class="italic">That one small ship and two puck-sized satellites could do?</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- This was not mentioned.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin said nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There were some potentially unfortunate consequences implicit in a profound belief in the Truth. One was that there was a possibility that when the simulation ended, all the people being simulated would cease to exist entirely. The sim might be turned off and everybody within the substrate running it would die. There might be no promotion, no release, no return to a bigger and better and finer outside: there might just be the ultimate mass extinction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Also, back in the (apparently) real world, there was an argument that the Truth implied approval of its own extinctions, that it tacitly encouraged mass murder and genocide. Logically, if one way of upping the proportion of those who truly believed was to evangelise, convince and convert, another was to decrease the numbers of those who steadfastly refused to accept the Truth at all - if necessary by killing them. The tipping point into revelation and deliverance for all might come not at the moment when a sceptic became a believer but at the point that an unreformable heathen breathed their last.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> plunged into a great dark wall of thicker cloud, dimming the view. Lights started to come on, shining from the supporting structure and the Dweller skiffs. Soon they could see little, and the mad, overwhelming cacophony of the slipstream and the droning engines made sonosense near impossible. A methane hail rattled around them in the gathering gloom.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Time to go in, perhaps, the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Amen.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The next day brought target practice, as the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>’s weapons and crew were brought up to some form of war-readiness. Y’sul, Hatherence and Fassin were allowed to watch from inside an observation dome right at the front of the ship, a temporary structure protruding from the Dreadnought’s armoured nose like a little bubble of diamond. They shared the place with a few dozen interested civilians, mostly administrators of the various cities where the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> had been paying courtesy calls during the last long period of peace. Uniformed pet-children floated amongst the VIPs, carrying trays of food and drugs.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ahead, through a ten-kilometre gap in the clouds, they could see an object like a small bright blue ship, a target being towed by another Dreadnought a hundred or more klicks still further ahead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> shuddered mightily and an instant later there came a great blast of noise. Tracks like dozens of vapour trails appeared in the sky beneath and above them, great combs of thin, plaited gas racing in front of them headed by the barely glimpsed dark dots of the shells converging on the target. Screens set into each dent-seat - where working - showed a magnified view of the blue target; it shook as its hollow structure was punctured by the shells, holes appearing briefly on its hull before sealing up again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A desultory cheer went up from a few of the generally bored-looking Dwellers present. It was drowned out by the clicking of maniple fingers demanding service from the pet-children waiters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I never asked,’ Hatherence said, leaning close to Y’sul as he snorted up the coils of purple from a fuming stoke-pipe. ‘What is the war actually about?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul turned jerkily and gave the impression of trying to get his outer sensory regions to focus on the colonel. ‘About?’ he said, looking confused. The exhausted stoke-stick attached to the pipe went out with a loud ‘pop’. ‘Well, it’s about when two, ah, opposing groups of, ah people, ah, that is to say, Dwellers, in this case, obviously, decide to, umm, fight. Fight! Yes, usually over some issue, and . . . and they use weapons of war to do so, until one side or other - did I say there are usually just two sides? That’s kind of the conventional number, I believe. Sort of a quorum, you might say. Though—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I wasn’t looking for the definition of a war, Y’sul.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No? Good. I thought you probably had such things of your own. Most people seem to.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I meant, what is the point at issue? What is the cause of the war?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The cause?’ Y’sul asked, looking surprised. He roted as far back in his dent-seat as he could while the ship shuddered again and another salvo, from each side of the vessel this time, lanced forwards to the distant target. ‘Well,’ he said, distracted by the dancing dots of the shells dragging their gas trails after them. ‘Well, I’m sure there <span class="italic">is</span> one . . .’ He started mumbling. Hatherence seemed to realise she’d already got as much sense out of Y’sul as she was going to while he was sucking on the stoke-pipe, and settled back in her seat with a sigh.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Dweller Formal Wars are like duels fought on a huge scale, Fassin told her. The colonel turned fractionally towards him. - Normally about some aesthetic dispute. They’re often the final stage of a planet-planning dispute.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Planet-planning?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A common one is where there’s some dispute concerning the number of belts and zones a planet ought to have. Then, the Odds and the Evens are the two sides, usually.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- <span class="italic">Planet</span>-planning? the colonel repeated, as though she hadn’t picked up right the first time. - I did not think gas-giants were, well, planned.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The Dwellers claim they can alter the number of bands a planet has, over a sufficiently great amount of time. They’ve never been reliably observed doing this but that doesn’t stop them claiming to be able to do it. Anyway, it’s not the doing of the thing that matters, it’s the principle. What sort of world do we want to live in? That’s the question.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Even or Odd?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Exactly. A Formal War is just the working-out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another salvo. The ship really shook this time, and a number of the slave-children yelped at the ragged boom resulting. Combs of gas trails leapt from all sides, a cone defining a tunnel of braided sky in front of them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Wars are also fought over disagreements such as which GasClipper ought to be allowed to fly a certain pennant colour during a race.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A war for this? Hatherence sounded genuinely horrified. - Have these people never heard of committees?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh, they have committees and meetings and dispute procedures. They have <span class="italic">lots</span> of those. But getting Dwellers to stick with a decision that’s gone against them, even after they’ve sworn on their life beforehand that they’ll abide by it, is not the easiest thing to do, in this or any other world. So disagreements tend to rumble on. Formal Wars are just the Dweller equivalent of a Supreme Court, a tribunal of last resort. Also, you have to understand that they don’t really have standing armed forces as such. Between wars, the Dreadnoughts and other military bits and pieces are cared for by enthusiasts, by clubs. Even when a Formal War is declared, all that happens is that the clubs get bigger as ordinary people sign up. The clubs sound and feel like what you or I might understand as proper military authorities but they’ve no legal standing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel shook as though just confronted with something of ultimate grisliness. - How perverse.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- For them, it seems to work.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The verb ‘work’, Hatherence sent, - like so many other common terms, seems to be required to take on additional meanings when one talks of Dwellers. How do they decide who’s won one of these bizarre conflicts?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Occasionally a straight dead-count, or the number of Dreadnoughts destroyed or crippled. More usually there’ll be an elegance threshold pre-agreed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- An elegance threshold?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hatherence, Fassin said, turning to her, - did you do <span class="italic">any</span> research into Dweller life? All that time in—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I believe I encountered a mention of this concept but dismissed it at the time as fanciful. It genuinely counts in such matters?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It genuinely counts.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And they can’t agree a workable disputes procedure for what ship flies which colourings without resorting to war, but they can happily agree on that resulting war being decided on a concept as fuzzy as <span class="italic">elegance</span>?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh, that’s never disputed. They have an algorithm for it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another terrific judder rang the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> like a dull bell. The thin, uncoiling tracks combed the sky ahead of them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- An algorithm? the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Elegance is an algorithm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screens showed the blue target quaking under the impact of a handful of shells. Hatherence glanced at Y’sul, who was trying to blow purple smoke rings and pierce them with a rim arm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And it’s all run by clubs, she said. - Of enthusiasts.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- <span class="italic">Clubs?</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Big clubs, Hatherence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So is all this why their war technology is so awful? she asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- <span class="italic">Is</span> it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin, Hatherence said, sounding amused now. - These people claim to have been around since the week after reionisation and building these Dreadnought things for most of that time, yet that target is less than a dozen klicks ahead, each salvo is thirty-six shells—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Thirty-three. One of the turrets is out of action.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Regardless. They are only hitting that effectively unmoving target with every second or third round. That is simply pathetic.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There are rules, formulae.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Insisting on ludicrously inefficient gunnery?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- In a sense. No guided shells, all guns and aiming systems to be based on ancient patterns, no jet engines for the Dreadnoughts, no rocket engines for the missiles, no particle or beam weapons at all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Like duels fought with ancient pistols.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You’re getting the idea.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And this is meant to keep them all in martial trim in case they are invaded by outside hostiles?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, yes, Fassin agreed. - That does begin to look like a slightly hollow claim when you actually see the technology, doesn’t it? Of course, they claim they’ve got star-busting hyper-weapons hidden about the place somewhere, just in case, and the skills are somehow transferable, but . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Nobody’s ever seen them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Something like that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> unleashed its mighty anti-ship missiles, loosing what was probably meant to be a twelve-strong broadside. The eleven tiny, slim projectiles came screaming from all sides of the great vessel - the slave-children yelped again and some dropped their trays - and hurtled out towards the distant blue target drone on smoky, twisting plumes of jet exhaust like deranged darts. Two of the missiles drifted too close to one another; each appeared to identify the other as its intended target and so both swung wildly at their opposite number, missed, twisted round in a sweeping double braid, flew straight at each other and this time met and exploded in a modest double fireball. Some Dwellers in the observation lounge - distracted, perhaps sarcastic - cheered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A third missile seemed to take the nearby explosion as a sign that it ought to perform an upward loop and head straight back at the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>. ‘Oh-oh,’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The oncoming missile settled into a flat, steady course, becoming a small but rapidly enlarging dot, aimed straight at the nose of the Dreadnought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They <span class="italic">do</span> have destructs, don’t they?’ Hatherence said, glancing at Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Some Dwellers started looking at each other, then made a dash for the access tube to the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>’s armoured nose, creating a jam around the door. Slave-children, also trying to escape, either got through ahead of the rush or were thrown roughly out of the way, yelping.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The dot in the sky was getting bigger.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They can just order it to blow up, can’t they?’ the colonel said, roting backwards. A high, whining noise seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the colonel’s esuit. The yelling, cursing knot of Dwellers round the exit didn’t seem to be shifting. The <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> was starting to turn, hopelessly slowly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘In theory they can destruct it,’ Fassin said uneasily, watching the still unshifting mêlée around the exit. ‘And they do have close-range intercept guns.’ Another frantic slave-child was ejected upwards from the scrum by the door, screaming until it slapped into the ceiling and dropped lifeless to the slowly tilting deck.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The missile had real shape now, no longer a large dot. Stubby wings and a tailplane were visible. The <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> continued to turn with excruciating slowness. The missile plunged in towards them on a trail of sooty exhaust. Hatherence rose from her dent-seat but moved closer to the diamond-sheath nose of the observation blister, not further away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Stay back, major, she sent. Then a terrific tearing, ripping noise sounded from above and behind them, a net of finger-fine trails filled the gas ahead of the ship’s nose and the missile first started to disintegrate and then blew up. The interceptor machine gun somewhere behind continued firing, scoring multiple hits on the larger pieces of smoking, glowing missile wreckage as they tumbled on towards the <span class="italic">Stormshear</span>, so that when the resulting shrapnel hit and punctured the observation blister it caused relatively little damage, and only minor wounds.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The Dreadnought took them as far as Munueyn, a Ruined City fallen amongst the dark, thick gases of the lower atmosphere where slow coils of turbulence roiled past like the heavy, lascivious licks of an almighty planetary tongue, a place all spires and spindles, near-deserted, long unfashionable, a one-time Storm-Centre now too far from anything to be of much interest to anybody, a place that might have garnered kudos for itself had it been near a war zone, but could hope for almost none at all because it was within one. A wing-frigate took them from the Dreadnought and deposited them in the gigantic echoing hall of what had once been the city’s bustling StationPort, where they were greeted like returning heroes, like gods, by the local hirers and fliers. They found a guest house for negative kudos. They were, in effect, being paid to stay there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir!’ Sholish said, rising from the mass of petitioners in the small courtyard below. ‘A hostelier of impeccable repute with excellent familial connections in the matter of wartime travel warrants beseeches you to consider his proposal to put at your disposal a veritable fleet of a half-half-dozen finely arrayed craft, all in the very best of condition and working order and ready to depart within less than an hour of their arrival.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Which will be when, precisely, banelet of my already too-long life?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A day, sire. Two, at the most. He assures.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Unacceptable! Utterly and profoundly so!’ Y’sul proclaimed, frilling the very idea away with a shudder. He was nestled within a dent on a flower-decked terrace outside and above the Taverna Bucolica, close enough to the city’s central plaza to smell the mayor’s desperation. He dragged deep of a proffered pharma cylinder and with the exhalation breathed, ‘Next!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin and the colonel, floating nearby, exchanged looks. Hatherence floated closer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We could just take off, you and I.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- All by ourselves?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We are both self-sufficient, we are both capable of making good time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You reckon?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel made it obvious that she was looking his arrowcraft over. - I think so.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">I think you called up the specs on this thing before we left Third Fury and know damn well so</span>, he thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He sent, - So we go haring off into the clouds together, just we two.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There is a problem.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Indeed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- In fact, there are two problems. The first one is that there’s a war on, and we’ll look like a pair of warheads.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Warheads? But we shan’t even be transonic!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There are rules in Formal War regarding the speed that warheads can travel at. We’ll look like warheads.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm. If we went a little slower?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Slow warheads.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Slower still?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Cruise mines. And before you ask, any slower than that and we’ll look like ordinary monolayer float mines.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence bobbed up and down, a sigh. - You mentioned a second problem.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Without Y’sul it’s unlikely that anybody will talk to us.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- With him it is unlikely that anybody else will get a word in.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Nevertheless.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They needed their own transport. More to the point, they needed transport that would be allowed to pass unchallenged in the war zone. Whatever remained of Valseir’s old dwelling lay far enough off the CloudTunnel network to make roting or floating their way there too long-winded. Y’sul had agreed to fix things - with his equatorial, big-city connections, escorting exotic aliens, he was bound to positively exude kudos towards all those who might help him - but then had got caught up in the whole process just due to the numbers of people who wanted to be the ones who helped him, and so became unable, seemingly, to make up his mind. Just as it seemed likely he was about to settle on one outrageously generous offer, another would appear over the horizon, even more enticing, necessitating a further reappraisal.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Finally, after two days, Hatherence could take no more and hired her own ship, on terms slightly better than the ones just rejected by Y’sul.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In their suite at the Taverna, Y’sul protested. ‘I am doing the negotiating!’ he bellowed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ the colonel agreed. ‘Rather too much of it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A compromise was arrived at. The colonel confessed to their hirer that she was legally unable to commit to a firm contract and Y’sul then remade it on the exact same terms while the appalled shipmaster was still drawing breath to protest. That day, the day the war officially got under way, ceremonially beginning with an opening gala and Formal Duel in Pihirumime, half the world away. A day later they sailed - taking the next downward eddy that also swirled in the right horizontal direction - aboard the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>, a hundred-metre twin-hull screwburster of unknown but probably enormous age. It boasted a crew of just five apart from its captain and was rotund and slow, but was - for some reason lost in the mists of Dweller military logic - still registered as an uncommitted privateer scout ship and so cleared to make her way within the war zone and, one might hope, liable to pass any consequent challenge save one conducted by opening fire prior to negotiations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Their captain was Slyne, an enthusiastic youngster barely arrived at Adulthood, still very much a Recent and behaving more like a Youth. He’d inherited the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> on the death of his father. The Dwellers clove to the idea of Collective Inheritance, so that, when one of them died, any private property they could fairly claim to have accumulated went fifty per cent to whoever they wanted it to go to and fifty per cent to whatever jurisdiction they lived within. This was why only one hull of the twin-hulled <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> was fully owned by Slyne. The city of Munueyn owned the other half and was renting it to him, accumulating kudos. The less Slyne could actually do with the ship, the more control he would lose, until ultimately the city could reasonably claim it was all theirs; then, if he wanted to stay aboard, he’d more or less have to do whatever the city asked him to do with the ship. This expedition, however, conducted under his own auspices, ought to go a long way towards securing his ownership rights over the whole vessel.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This is why we are confined to the single hull?’ Hatherence asked the captain. They were on the foredeck, a slightly ramshackle sprouting of fibres and sheet protruding over the craft’s battered-looking nose. Y’sul had spotted a harpoon gun on the foredeck and challenged his companions to a coarse shoot the next time they traversed a promising volume. Apparently where they were now, just two days out of Munueyn, constituted just such a happy hunting ground - however, nobody had seen anything worth harpooning so far.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s right!’ Slyne bobbed eagerly over the deck. ‘Less I use the other hull, less I owe the city!’ Captain Slyne was hanging on to some rigging, floating above everybody else to get a good view and act as lookout and target spotter. They were making a decent speed through the dim crimson gases. The slipstream would have blown Slyne aft if he hadn’t been holding on. A decent speed in this case meant less than a quarter of the velocity of the Dreadnought <span class="italic">Stormshear</span> on cruise, but the gas down here was thicker and the slipstream’s force was all the greater.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There’s something!’ Slyne yelled, pointing up and to starboard.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They all looked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No! Wrong,’ Slyne said cheerfully. ‘Beg pardon.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne was taking his captain’s role seriously, accoutred with lots of mostly useless ancient naval paraphernalia like spyglasses, an altimeter, a museum-piece radio, a scratched-looking hail visor, a shining antique holster-cannon and a radiation compass. His clothing and half-armour looked very new but based on designs that were very old. He had a couple of pet foetuses tethered to each of his Hub girdles.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The foetuses were Dweller young who hadn’t even been allowed to progress to the stage of being children. The usual reason they existed was because a Dweller-turned-female of particular impatience had decided she couldn’t be bothered going to full term, and had aborted. The results made good pets. Dwellers could survive on their own almost from conception, they just didn’t progress intellectually and had nobody to protect them while they were completely helpless.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne’s quadruplets - it would have been impolite to inquire whether they were actually his own - looked like little bloated manta rays, pale and trailing almost useless tentacles, forever bumping into their master or each other and getting themselves tangled in their tethers. The effect, for a human, was inevitably slightly grisly, though Fassin had the added, depressing feeling that the foetuses were the equivalent of a parrot in ancient Earth terms.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There’s something this time!’ Slyne shouted, pointing down to starboard. A small, black object was rising from the deep red depths of gas a couple of hundred metres away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I have it!’ Y’sul yelled, bump-kicking the gun platform on its counterweights. It swung up above the deck to an elevation that let him depress the harpoon gun sufficiently.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A tchoufer seed!’ Sholish exclaimed. ‘It’s a tchoufer tree seed, sir!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Wait a moment, Y’sul,’ Fassin said, rising from the deck. ‘Just let me go and check.’ He gunned the little gascraft away from the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>, curving out and down towards the still slowly rising black sphere.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Keep out of the way!’ Y’sul bellowed to the human. Fassin had taken a curved course deliberately, having witnessed Y’sul’s marksmanship before.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just hold, will you?’ he shouted back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul gave a shake and sighted the gun on the black sphere, maniples grasping the trigger.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne craned forward in the rigging. Two of the foetuses wrapped themselves round a stay, entangling him. He looked up, tutted, and brought his spyglass up to a receptor-dense portion of his sensory frill, scanning the rising black orb. ‘Ah, actually—’ he began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence bobbed up suddenly. ‘Y’sul! Stop!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ha-<span class="italic">ha</span>!’ Y’sul said, twisting the trigger and firing the harpoon. The mounting shook, the gun leapt and banged, the harpoon’s own twin rocket motors sprang out and erupted as soon as it was a safe distance away and the thin black line attached to the main body came whipping and whistling out of a locker just beneath the gun mounting. The harpoon rasped through the gas towards where the black object would be in a few seconds’ time. ‘Hmm,’ Y’sul said, sounding slightly surprised. ‘One of my better—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s a mine!’ Slyne screamed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sholish just screamed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin, get away from that thing! Hatherence sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little gascraft instantly started to turn and speed up, rotors blurring in the air.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eh? What?’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne drew his holster-cannon and aimed at the harpoon. He got one shot off before the gun jammed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Could that be nuclear?’ the colonel shouted. A high, keening noise sounded from the colonel’s esuit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Definitely!’ Slyne spluttered. He shook his gun and cursed, then slapped at his radio. ‘Engines! Full astern!’ He shook the gun again, desperately. ‘Fucking <span class="italic">scrits</span>!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence moved quickly to one side.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul looked out at the harpoon, dropping smoothly right on course for the black ball, then at the gun mounting. ‘Sholish!’ he barked. ‘Grab that line!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sholish leapt for the thrumming dark curtain of cord being jerked from the locker under the gun, caught hold of it and was instantly whipped towards the gunwales, smashing through stanchions and snapping to a stop, tangled in the hawser, before the slipstream brought him thudding back into the deck behind them. Free of the encumbering line, the harpoon just picked up speed, still heading for the mine. Hatherence got clear of the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>. Fassin’s arrowcraft was still turning, still picking up speed, still even closer to the mine than the ship was.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, fu—’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A crimson flash seemed to wash out the gas all around them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Dead</span>, Fassin had time to think.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">For an instant, a tight fan of searing pink-white lines joined Colonel Hatherence’s esuit and the full length of the harpoon, which vanished in a blast of heat and light. A visible shock-sphere pulsed out from the detonation, rocking the mine . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">. . . Which seemed to stop and think for a moment, before continuing to ascend smoothly on its way. The shock wave shook them and the ship. Fassin felt it too. He slowed and turned back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> was scrubbing off speed following Slyne’s last order. The slipstream was lessening but still sufficiently strong to clunk Sholish’s battered carapace off the deck as he floated tangled in the dark mass of wire.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul looked. ‘Sholish?’ he said in a small voice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘The species of the Faring are more divided by their sense of time than anything else. We Dwellers, being who and what we are, naturally encompass as much of the spectrum of chronosense as we are able, covering most of it. I exclude the machine-Quick.’ A hesitation. ‘You still abhor those, I take it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, we most certainly do!’ the colonel exclaimed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Positively persecuted,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm. They are different again, of course. But even within the limits of the naturally evolved, the manifold rates at which time is appreciated are, some would argue, collectively the single most telling distinction that might be made between species and species-types.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The speaker was an ancient Sage called Jundriance. Dweller seniority nomenclature stretched to twenty-nine separate categories, starting with child and ending, no less than two billion years later (usually much more) at Child. In between came the short-lived Adolescent and Youth stages, the rather longer Adult stage with its three sub-divisions, then Prime, with four sub-divisions, Cuspian with three and then, if the Dweller had survived to that age (one and a quarter million years, minimum) and was judged fit by his peers, Sagehood, which then repeated all the subdivisions of the Adulthood, Prime and Cuspian stages. So, technically, Jundriance was a Sage-prime-chice. He was forty-three million years old, had shrunk to only six metres in diameter - while his carapace had darkened and taken on the hazy patina of Dweller middle age - had already lost most of his limbs and he was in charge of what was left of the house and associated libraries of the presumed deceased Cuspian-choal Valseir.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The view from the house was motionless and unchanging at normal time, a hazy vista of deep brown and purple veils of gas within a great placid vertical cylinder of darkness that was the final echo of the great storm that the house had once swung about like a tiny planet around a great, cold sun. In appearance the house-library complex itself was a collection of thirty-two spheres, each seventy metres or so in diameter, many girdled by equatorial balconies, so that the construction looked like some improbably bunched gathering of ringed planets. The bubble house hung, very slowly sinking, in that great calm of thick gas, deep down in the dark, hot depths only a few tens of kilometres above the region where the atmosphere began to behave more like a liquid than a gas.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This is his house, then, yes?’ the colonel had asked when they’d first seen it from the foredeck of the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had looked around, using sonosense and magnetic to search for the section of the derelict CloudTunnel that the house had once been anchored to, but couldn’t find it anywhere nearby. He’d already checked the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>’s charts. The stretch of CloudTunnel no longer showed up on the local holo maps, implying that it had either drifted much further away - which was unlikely - or had fallen into the depths.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Yes, looks like it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d had to turn the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> around and return to Munueyn. Sholish, badly injured, had been taken to hospital. The surgeons had given him an even chance of surviving. He’d heal best left in a drug coma for the next few hundred days. There was nothing more they could do.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul could have taken on any number of Youths and Adolescents eager to take his crippled servant’s place, but he’d turned them all down - a decision he’d regretted just a day or so later once they’d set out again, when he’d realised he had nobody to shout at.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d avoided challenges, other ships and mines of all sorts, finally making the journey in ten days. The Sage Jundriance was attended by a couple of burly Prime servants, Nuern and Livilido, each dressed in fussily ornate and ill-fitting academic robes. They were sufficiently senior to have servants of their own; a half-dozen highly reticent Adults who looked like identical sextuplets. They were big on scurrying but almost autistically shy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The senior of the two elder servants, Nuern - a mouean to Livilido’s one-rank-more-junior suhrl - had welcomed them, allocated rooms and informed them that his master was engaged in the task of cataloguing the remaining works in the libraries - as Y’sul had warned, a significant proportion of the contents had been given away since Valseir’s accident. Probably only the remoteness of the house had prevented more scholars showing up to pick over the remains. Jundriance was, however, in slowtime, so if they wanted to speak to him they would have to slow to his thought-pace. Fassin and the colonel had agreed. Y’sul had announced he was having none of this and took the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> on a cruise to explore the local volume and see what there might be to hunt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Your duty should be to wait for us,’ the colonel had informed him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Duty?’ Y’sul had said, as though hearing the word for the first time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They had a half-day or so, at least, while Jundriance was informed by a message on his read-screen that he had visitors. If he would see them immediately, they could go in before dark. Otherwise it could be some long time . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Colonel,’ Fassin had said, ‘we will have to go into slow-down for some time. Y’sul might be as well amusing himself nearby -’ Fassin had turned to look at Y’sul to emphasise the word ‘- as mooching about this place for who knows how long.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- He’ll get into trouble.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Probably. So, better trouble close to home, or trouble further away?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence had made a rumbling noise and had told Y’sul, ‘There is a war on.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ve checked the nets!’ Y’sul had protested. ‘It’s kilo-klicks away!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Really?’ Nuern had said, perking. ‘Has it started? The master doesn’t allow connections in the house. We hear nothing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Began a dozen days ago,’ Y’sul had told the servant. ‘We’ve been in the thick of it already. Barely avoided a smart mine on the way here. My servant got himself injured, may die.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A smart mine? Near here?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You are right to be concerned, my friend,’ Y’sul had said solemnly. ‘The presence of such ordnance hereabouts is another - the real - reason why I’ll take my ship on patrol around you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And your servant, injured. How terrible.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know. War is. Other than that, elsewhere in the hostilities, barely a spineful of deaths so far. Couple of Dreadnoughts crippled on each side. Far too early to tell who’s winning. I’ll keep a fringe cocked, let you know what’s happening.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thank you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not at all.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You’re right, Hatherence had signal-whispered to Fassin as this exchange was taking place. - Let’s just let him go.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You can signal the ship from your esuit while still in slowdown?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Okay.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You will stay nearby?’ Fassin had asked Y’sul. ‘You won’t let the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> venture too far out?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course! I swear! And I shall ask our two fine fellows here to extend you every courtesy on my behalf!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were to be seen at once. Nuern had shown them into one of the outer library pods. The library had a roof of diamond leaf looking directly upwards into the vermilion-dark sky. Jundriance was settled into a dent-desk near the centre of the near-spherical room, facing a read-screen. Around him, the walls were lined with shelves, some so widely spaced that they might have doubled as bunk space for humans, others so small that a child’s finger might have struggled to fit. Mostly these held books, of some sort. Spindle-secured carousels tensioned between the walls and between the floor and a network of struts above held hundreds of other types of storage devices and systems: swave crystals, holoshard, picospool and a dozen more obscure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d joined Jundriance at his desk, floating through the thick atmosphere to his side. Nuern had swung dent-seats into place and they’d both clamped onto one, Hatherence positioning herself with Fassin between her and the Sage. Jundriance, of course, gave no sign of having noticed them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d slowed. It had been much easier for Fassin than for Hatherence. He’d been doing this for centuries; she’d been trained in the technique but had never attempted it for real. The experience would be a jerky, shaky journey for her, at least until they smoothed out at the Sage’s pace.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The day darkened quickly, then the night seemed to last less than an hour. Fassin concentrated on his own smooth slowdown, but was aware of the colonel seeming to wriggle and shift in her dent-seat. The Sage Jundriance appeared to stir. By the next quick morning, something actually changed on his reading screen; another page. That day passed quickly, then the next night went quicker still. The process continued until they were down to a factor of about one-in-sixty-four, which was what they had been told Jundriance had come up to meet them at - he’d been even slower until their arrival.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were about halfway there when a signal-whisper had pinged into the little gascraft. - You receiving this all right, major?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes. Why?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I just interrogated the screen reader. It was working in real-time until the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> arrived.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You sure?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Perfectly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Interesting.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Finally they were there, synchronised to the same life-pace as the Sage. The short days became a slow, slow flicker above them, the orange-purple sky beyond the diamond leaf alternately lightening and dimming. Even at this pace, the great tall veils of gas seemed to hang above them in the sky, unmoving. Fassin had experienced the feeling he always got when he first went into slowdown during a delve, the disquieting sensation that he was a lost soul, the feeling of being in a strange sort of prison, trapped in time inside while life went on at a quicker pace outside, above, beyond.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Jundriance had turned off his read-screen and greeted them. Fassin had asked about Valseir but somehow they’d got onto the subject of life-pace itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One feels sorry for the Quick, I suppose,’ the Sage said. ‘They seem ill-suited to the universe, in a way. The distances between the stars, the time it takes to travel from one to another . . . Even more so, of course, if one is thinking of travelling between galaxies.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A hole in the conversation. ‘Of course.’ Fassin said, to fill it. <span class="italic">Are you fishing for something, old one?</span> he thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The machines. They were much worse, of course. How unbearable, to live so quickly.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, they mostly don’t live at all now, Sage,’ Fassin told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That is as well, perhaps.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sage, can you tell us any more about Valseir’s death?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was not there. I know no more than you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You were . . . quite close to him?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Close? No. No, I would not say so. We had corresponded on matters of textual verification and provenance, and debated at a remove on various questions of scholarship and interpretation, though not regularly. We never met. I would not say that that constituted closeness, would you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I suppose not. I just wondered what drew you here, that’s all.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, the chance to look through his library. To take what I might for myself. That is what drew me. His servants took some material before they left, others - mostly scholars or those who chose to call themselves such - came and took what they wanted, but there is still much here, and while the most obvious treasures are gone, much of value may remain. It would be derelict to ignore.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see. And what of Valseir’s libraries? I understand you are continuing to catalogue them?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A pause. ‘Continuing. Yes.’ The old, dark-carapaced Sage seemed to stare at the dark read-screen. ‘Hmm,’ he said. He turned fractionally to look at Fassin. ‘Let me see. Your use of the word “continuing” there.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I understood that Valseir had been cataloguing his libraries. Wasn’t he?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He was always so secretive. Was he not?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’m getting light-comms leakage here, Hatherence sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Tell me if there’s a burst after this:</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And dilatory. Hapuerele always said that Valseir was more likely to win the All-Storms Yachting Cup than ever finish cataloguing his libraries.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another pause. ‘Quite so, quite so. Hapuerele, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Leakage. Hapuerele does not exist?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Exists, but he had to ask elsewhere just there. Shouldn’t have.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I would like to take a look round some of the libraries myself. I hope you don’t mind. I shan’t disturb you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah. I see. Well, if you think you can be discreet. Are you seeking anything in particular, Mr Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes. And you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Only enlightenment. And what would it be that you are looking for, if I may ask?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Exactly the same.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old dweller was silent for a while. In real-time, most of an hour passed. ‘I may have something for you,’ he said eventually. ‘Would you care to slow down a little more? No doubt this, our present pace, seems surpassing slow to you; however, I find it something of a strain.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course,’ Fassin told Jundriance.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’ll have to leave you here, major.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Lucky you. I’ll try to keep this short.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Good luck, Hatherence sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘However, I shall leave you at this point, sir,’ the colonel said to the Sage.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Pleasant to have met you, Reverend Colonel,’ Jundriance told her. ‘Now then,’ he said to Fassin. ‘Let me see. Half this pace, I think, Seer Taak, would suit me better. A quarter would suit me better still.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shall we try half, then, initially?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>He was back in just three days. Hatherence was inspecting the contents of another library when he found her. The room was almost perfectly spherical, with no windows, just a circle of dim light shining from the ceiling’s centre and further luminescence provided by bio strips inlaid on each shelf, glowing ghostly green. Further stacks of shelves like enormous inward-pointing vanes made the place feel oddly organic, as though these were ribs, and they were inside some vast creature. The colonel was floating near one set of close-stacked shelves near the library’s centre, strips of green light ribbing her esuit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So soon, major?’ Hatherence said, replacing a slim holocrystal on a shelf half full of them. At the same time as she spoke, she sent: - Our friend had nothing of interest?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sage Jundriance gave me so much to think about that I decided I’d better come back to normal speed to think it over,’ Fassin replied, then signalled, - The old bastard gave me fuck all; basically he’s trying to stall us.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, I have been studying while you were conversing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Anything of interest?’ he asked, floating over towards her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There are signs that many more Dwellers were staying here until not long ago. Perhaps only a few days long ago. ‘The house system seems to think there ought to be a catalogue of catalogues somewhere. In fact that there ought to be multiple copies of it lying around.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A catalogue of catalogues?’ Fassin said. - Other Dwellers?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The first catalogue that Valseir compiled, listing the catalogues of individual works he would then draw up.’ - Perhaps as many as ten or twelve. Also, I get the impression Livilido and Nuern are more, or at least other, than they appear.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One catalogue for everything would be too simple?’ Fassin asked, then sent, - I didn’t think they seemed like ordinary servants either. So where are all these multiple copies?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I suspect they have been removed. They would be the key to beginning a methodical search, the colonel replied, then said, ‘I gather it seemed to him the logical way to proceed. Certainly there is no shortage of material, even yet, when much of it has been removed. One catalogue would, I suppose, be cumbersome.’ The Colonel paused. ‘Of course, a single giant database with freely dimensioned subdivisions, partially overlapping categories and subcategories, a hierarchically scalable cross-reference hyperstructure and inbuilt, semi-smart user-learning routines would be even more to the point and far more useful.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at her. ‘He’d probably have got round to one of those after he’d done what he considered the proper cataloguing - getting everything down in some non-volatile form that can be read without intervening machinery.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Our Dweller friends do seem to be remarkably purist about such things.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘When you live as long as they do, future-proofing becomes an obsession.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Perhaps that is their curse. The Quick must endure the frustration of living in a universe with what seems like an annoyingly slow speed limit and the Slow must suffer the frenetic pace of change around them, resulting in a sort of exaggerated entropy.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had been floating slowly closer to Hatherence. He tipped to make it clear that he was looking at her as he came to a stop a couple of metres from her. The glowing biostrips on the shelves painted soft lime stripes across the little gascraft. ‘You all right in there, colonel?’ he asked. ‘I realise it’s very hot and pressured down here.’ - Colonel, do you think we are wasting our time here?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am fine. Yourself?’ - Very hard to say. There is so much still here, so much to be looked at.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Also fine. Feeling very rested.’ - That’s my point. We could be made to waste a lot of time here, looking for something that has already been removed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I understand slow-time will have that effect.’ - That is a thought. I had the odd impression, from dust marks and so on, understand, that many of the shelves have recently been filled, or refilled. And many of the works seem to make no sense given what I’ve understood of Valseir’s subjects of study. Seemed most strange. Though, if all this is a sort of slow-trap for you and me, then that begins to make sense. But what else can we do? Where else is there to go?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll have to talk to the Sage again,’ Fassin said. ‘There are many things I’d like to ask him.’ - Whereas in fact I’ll do everything I can to avoid talking to the old bore again. We have to get word out to any legitimate scholars who did take works from here, see if any of them have the catalogues, or anything else. There are two dozen separate libraries here; even if they’re only half-full we could be searching them for decades.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He is a most interesting and wise character.’ - Many tens of millions of works, and if most are unsorted, all are. I’ll signal to the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>, have them put out word to the relevant scholars. Who might be trying to put obstacles in our way so?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed he is.’ - I don’t know.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, I think I shall continue to search the shelves for a while. Will you join me?’ - Will you?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why not?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They drifted to different but nearby stacks, snicked holocrystal books out of their motion-proof shelves, and read.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘His study?’ Nuern asked. A fringe flick indicated a glance at Livilido. They were afloat at table. The two Primes had invited Fassin and Hatherence to a semi-formal dinner in the house’s ovaloid dining room, a great, dim, echoing space strung vertically with enormous sets of carbon ropes, all splayed, separated into smaller and smaller cords and fibres and threads and filaments and then each thin strand minutely and multiply knotted. It was like being inside some colossal, frayed net.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Jundriance was still deep in slow-time and would not be joining them. Special food had been prepared that was suitable for the colonel. She ingested it via a sort of gaslock on the side of her esuit. Fassin, contained and sustained within the arrowcraft, was really only here to watch.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Where do you think it might be?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I thought that Library One was his study,’ Nuern said, selecting a helping of something glowing dull blue from the central carousel, and then spinning the serving dish slowly towards his dining companions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Me too,’ Livilido said. He looked at Fassin. ‘Why, was there another one? Has a bit dropped off the place?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had taken a look round all the library spheres. Library One had always been Valseir’s formal study, where he received fellow scholars and other people, but it hadn’t been his <span class="italic">real</span> study, his den, his private space. Very few people were allowed in there. Fassin had felt flattered in the extreme to be invited to enter the nestlike nook that Valseir had made for himself inside the stretch of disused CloudTunnel tube which the rest of the house had been anchored to the last time Fassin had been here, centuries earlier. Library One still looked as it always had, minus a few thousand book-crystals and a big cylindrical low-temperature storage device in which Valseir had kept paper and plastic books. It certainly didn’t look as though the room had become Valseir’s proper study in the interim. And now it appeared as though these people didn’t even know he’d had a more private den in the first place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I thought he had another study,’ Fassin said. ‘Didn’t he keep a house in . . . what city was it? Guldrenk?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah! Of course,’ Nuern said. ‘That would be it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Colonel, these guys know nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I had been coming to the same conclusion.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Library Twenty-One (Cincturia/Clouders/Miscellania) had a conceit, a Dweller equivalent of a door made from a bookcase. Valseir had shown it to Fassin after the human had stayed with him for an extended period after their first meeting. It led, inward at first, towards the centre of the cluster of library spheres, through a short passage to a gap between two more of the outer spheres, then into the open gas. The joke - a hidden door, a secret passage - was that the various Cincturia were the outsiders of the galactic community, and the particular bookcase hiding the secret passage was categorised ‘Escapees’.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After their meal, Fassin gave the impression of shutting himself away in the library for some late-night shelf-scanning. Instead he screened up the house’s system statements and looked back to just after the time of Valseir’s yachting accident and alleged death. He did something unusual, something barely legal by Mercatorial standards and usually pointless on Nasqueron; he speeded up, letting the gascraft’s legal-max computers and his own subtly altered nervous system rev to their combined data-processing limit. It still took nearly half an hour, but he found what he was looking for: the point, a dozen days after Valseir’s accident, when the house recorded a rerouting of power and ventilation plumbing. Its altimeter had registered a wobble, too - a brief blip upwards, then the start of the long, slow descent that was continuing even now.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then Fassin had to work out where the CloudTunnel segment might be now. It would be beyond the start of the shear zone, past where the whole atmospheric band moved as a single vast mass, down into the semi-liquid Depths. These moved much more slowly than the gas above, the transition levels great turbidly elastic seas being dragged along as though reluctantly after the jet-stream whirl of atmosphere above.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was all dead reckoning. By the Dweller way of judging such things, the atmosphere was static and the Depths - not to mention the remainder of Ulubis system, the stars and indeed the rest of the universe - moved. With only notion-ally fixed reference points, finding anything in the Depths was notoriously difficult. After two hundred years the section of CloudTunnel could be anywhere; it might have sunk beyond feasible reach, been broken up or even drifted to the Zone edge and been pulled into another Belt entirely, either north or south. The only thing working in Fassin’s favour was that the length of tube he was looking for was relatively large. Completely losing something forty-plus metres in diameter and eighty klicks long wasn’t that easy, even in Nasqueron. Still, he was relying on the CloudTunnel retaining the usual profile of buoyancy-decay.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The likely volume - though identified with a worrying degree of fuzziness - was about five thousand kilcks away, though coming closer all the time, having been all the way round the planet many times. In a dozen hours it would be almost right underneath the house again. He calculated. It was doable. He pinged a note to the screen on the library’s door saying that he didn’t want to be disturbed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin let himself out through the hidden door about an hour after he’d entered the library. He let the little gascraft grow, pushing trim-spaces out to create internal vacuums and a larger, near-spherical outer shape so that he fell gently at first, causing as little turbulence as possible beneath the house. Then gradually he heavied, slowly shrinking the arrowhead to its dart-slim minimum, diving unpowered into the dark depths and through the rough boundary of the near-static cylinder of depleted gas that was all that remained of the ancient storm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He powered up twenty klicks deeper and levelled out, then rose quickly when he was thirty lateral kilometres clear, zooming up through the gradually cooling, slowly thinning gas above until he was through the haze layers and out amongst the cloud tops. Fassin increased to maximum speed, configuring the arrowhead for as stealthy a profile as it could support. The gascraft had never been designed for such shenanigans, but it had been gradually altered over the years by him and Hervil Apsile until - while no match for a genuine military machine - it made less of a fuss moving across the face of the planet than almost anything within the gas-giant’s atmosphere (always discounting the usual preposterous Dweller claims of invisible ships, inertialess drives and zero-point subspacials).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little craft moved beneath the thin yellow sky, and the stars above seemed to slow down then go into reverse as Fassin flew faster than the combined speed of the planet revolving and the band beneath him jet-streaming in the same direction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After less than an hour of flight, seeing nothing in the heavens above or in the skies beneath that would have led anyone to think there was life anywhere else in all the universe, he slowed and dropped, a shaftless arrowhead heading straight for the heart of the planet. He let the increasing density slow him further, feeling the resulting friction-heat leak through the gascraft’s hull and into his flesh.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Through the upper shear boundary - only hazily defined, kilometres thick, prone to vast slow waves and unpredictable swells and sudden troughs - he entered the shear zone itself, starting to circle through the crushing fluidity of jelly-thick atmosphere. If the section of CloudTunnel was still in the volume, this was where it ought to be, fallen amongst the depths, making its slow way down to an equilibrium of weight and buoyancy within the gradually thickening press of hydrogen gas turning to liquid.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was always a chance that it had gone the other way, lifting towards the cloud tops, but that would be unusual. Disused CloudTunnel, ribbed with vacuum tubes, tended to gain gas and therefore additional weight through osmosis over the millennia. When Fassin had been here two hundred years earlier, Valseir was already having to add buoyancy to the Tunnel to keep it from sinking too fast and dragging the whole house and library complex with it. Anyway, if the derelict section had risen it ought to have stayed within the same atmospheric band and so shown up somewhere on the charts of the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>, and it hadn’t.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He went on spiralling, keeping slow, sonosensing only gently so that there would be less chance of anybody who might be listening nearby overhearing him. (Could the colonel have followed him without him being aware of her? Probably. But why would she? Still, he had the feeling he ought to be as discreet as he could.) Light wasn’t much use. CloudTunnel wall would appear almost transparent down here. Probes for magnetic and radiation vestiges were of even less utility, and there would be no scent trace either.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After two hours, near the limit of the time that he thought he could reasonably spend away from the house, and some time after he’d decided the hell with discretion and ramped his active sensors up to maximum, Fassin found one end of the CloudTunnel, looming out of the gel-thick mist like a vast dark mouth. He took the little gascraft into the forty-metre-wide maw, turning up his sonosense now that the signals would be shielded by the walls of the CloudTunnel section itself. He increased his speed, too, barrelling along the great slowly curving tube like the ghost of some Dweller long gone.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The study shell was still there, a hollow sphere almost filling the CloudTunnel tube near the mid-point of its eighty-kilometre length, but it had been ransacked, stripped bare. Whatever secrets it might have held had long since been taken or trashed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin turned some lights on to check round the place, finding nothing intact, nothing beyond empty shelves and ragged lengths of carbon board, diamond dust like frosted ice and frayed fibres, waving in the turbulence of his passing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He formed a tiny cavity with his sonosense and watched it collapse instantly, snapped to nothing by the grinding weight of the column of gas above it. A fine place to feel crushed, he thought, then went back the way he’d come and ascended slowly to the house and Library Twenty-One again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel was there. She looked startled when he appeared from behind the hidden door, even though he’d told her earlier what he intended to do.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Major. Seer Taak. Fassin,’ she said. She sounded . . . odd.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked around. Nobody else here; <span class="italic">good</span>, he thought. ‘Yes?’ he said, letting the bookcase door close behind him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence floated right up to him, stopping just a metre away. Her esuit showed a uniform dull grey he hadn’t seen her display before.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Colonel,’ he asked her. ‘Are you all right? Is everything—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There is . . . you must prepare . . . I . . . I am sorry to . . . There is bad news, Fassin,’ she said finally, in a rushed, broken voice. ‘Very bad news. I am so sorry.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">The Archimandrite Luseferous did not really buy into the whole idea of the Truth. Of course, when he had been rising within the ranks of the Cessoria he had given every <span class="italic">appearance</span> of believing in it, and had been a gifted evangelist and disputer, arguing, many times, with great force, logic and passion for the Church and its views. He had been often commended for this. He could see at the time that his superiors were impressed, see it even when they didn’t want to admit to him or to themselves that they had been impressed. He had a gift for argument. And for dissembling, for lying (if you insisted on using such crude, un-nuanced terminology), for appearing to believe one thing while, at best, actually not caring one way or the other. He had never really cared whether the Truth was true.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The idea of faith interested him, even fascinated him, not as an intellectual idea, not as a concept or some abstract theoretical framework, but as a way of controlling people, as a way of understanding and so manipulating them. As a flaw, in the end, as something which was wrong with others that was not wrong with him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sometimes he could not believe all the advantages other people seemed prepared to hand him. They had faith and so would do things that were plainly not in their own immediate (or, often, long-term) best interests, because they just believed what they had been told; they experienced altruism and so did things that, again, were not necessarily to their advantage; they had sentimental or emotional attachments to others and so could be coerced, once more, into doing things they would not have done otherwise. And - best of all, he sometimes thought - people were self-deceiving. They thought they were brave when they were really cowards, or imagined they could think for themselves when they most blatantly could not, or believed they were clever when they were just good at passing exams, or thought they were compassionate when they were just sentimental.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The real strength came from a perfectly simple maxim: Be completely honest with yourself; only ever deceive others.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So many edges! So many ways that people made his progress easier. If everybody he’d ever met and competed with and struggled against had been just like him in these respects he’d have had a much harder rise to power. He might not even have prevailed at all, because without all these advantages it largely came down to luck, and he might not have had sufficient.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the old days he had once wondered how many of the Cessorian high command, his old bosses, really believed in the Truth. He strongly suspected that the higher you went, the greater grew the proportion of those who didn’t really believe at all. They were in it for the power, the glory, the control and the glamour.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Now he rarely thought about any of that. Now he would just assume that anybody in such a position would be completely and cynically self-interested and be mildly surprised and even slightly disgusted to find that any of them really did have genuine faith. The disgust would come from the feeling that the person concerned was letting down the side, and the suspicion that they would feel they were somehow - perversely - superior to their less-deluded peers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And so you really believe in all that? You really do?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir, of course, sir! It is the rational faith. Simple logic dictates. It is inescapable. You know this better than I, sir. Sir, I think you tease me.’ The girl looked away, smiling down, coquettish, shy, perhaps a little alarmed, just possibly even daring to feel slightly insulted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He reached out and took her hair, swinging her face round to his, a gold-dark silhouette against the sparse sprinkle of distant stars. ‘Child, I am not sure that in all my life I have ever teased. Not once.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The girl did not seem to know what to say. She looked around, perhaps at the pale stars through the screen-glass, perhaps at the snow-white tumble of low-gee puff-bedding, perhaps at the shell of screens forming the walls of their little nest, surfaces on which startlingly detailed and inventive acts of sexuality were being enacted. Perhaps she looked at her two companions, both now curled and asleep.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, then, sir,’ she said at last, ‘not teased. I would not say you teased me. Perhaps rather that you make fun of me because you are so much more educated and clever than me.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">That, the Archimandrite thought, was perhaps more like it. But he still was not sure. Did this young thing still carry the Truth inside her, even after all the normal-span generations that had come and gone since he’d formally swept away all this nonsense?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In a way it didn’t matter in the slightest; as long as nobody ever began to use their religion to organise against him he could not care less what people really thought. Obey me, fear me. Hate me if you want. Don’t ever pretend to love me. That was all he asked of people. Faith was just another lever, like sentiment, like empathy, like love (or what people thought was love, what they claimed was love, the fanciful, maybe even dishonest bit that wasn’t lust, which was honest. And, of course, another lever).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But he wanted to know. A less civilised fellow in his situation would have considered having the girl tortured to find out the truth, but people being tortured over something like this soon ended up just telling you what they thought you wanted to hear - anything to get the pain to stop. He’d learned that quickly enough. There was a better way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He reached for the pod’s remote control and adjusted the spin, creating the illusion of gravity once more. ‘Go on all fours in front of the window,’ he told the girl. ‘It’s time again.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir, of course, sir.’ The girl quickly assumed the position he wanted, crouched against the oncoming star field, seemingly fixed even though the pod was revolving. The brightest sun, screen dead-centre, was Ulubis.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous had had his genitals enhanced in all sorts of ways. One improvement was that he carried glands inside his body which allowed him to produce many different secretions which his ejaculate could then carry into the bodies of others (but whose effects he was proof against, obviously), including irritants, hallucinogens, cannabinoids, capsainoids, sleeping draughts and truth serums. He went briefly into the little-death little-trance, the petit mal which allowed him to select one of these, and chose the last-mentioned, the truth drug.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He took the girl anally; it was faster-acting that way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And discovered that she really did believe in the Truth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Though it also emerged that she thought he was horribly ancient and weird-looking and a frightening, sick-minded old sadist and she absolutely hated being fucked by him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He thought about inseminating her with thanaticin, or employing one of the physical options his remade penis made possible: the shaved horsetail, perhaps. Or just ejecting her into the vacuum and watching her die.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the end Luseferous decided that letting her live with such constant degradation was punishment enough. He’d always said he preferred being despised, after all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He would make her his favourite. Probably wise to put her on suicide watch, too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">The Dwellers held that the ability to suffer was what ultimately marked out sentient life from any other sort. They didn’t mean just the ability to feel physical pain, they meant real suffering, they meant the sort of suffering that was all the worse because the creature undergoing the experience could appreciate it fully, could think back to when it had not suffered so, look forward to when it might stop (or despair of it ever stopping - despair was a large component of this) and know that if things had been different it might not be suffering now. Brains required, see? Imagination. Any brainless thing with a rudimentary nervous system could feel pain. Suffering took intelligence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Of course, Dwellers didn’t feel pain, and claimed never to suffer, except in the trivial sense of suffering fools because they were part of the family, or experiencing the deleterious physical and mental effects of a serious hangover. So, by their own reckoning, they weren’t really sentient. At which point the average Dweller, assuming without question that they were absolutely self-evidently the most sentient and intelligent things around in anybody’s neck of the woods, would just throw their spine-limbs out, shake their mantle ruff and start talking loudly about paradoxes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He faced to spin, carried in the jet stream at five hundred kilometres per hour. Motionless. He side-slipped, found a small eddy, just a curl, a tiny yellow-white wisp a couple of klicks across in the great empty skies of orange and red and brown. He moved through the gas. It felt slick against the arrowhead’s skin. He let the eddy carry him round in a slow gyration for a while, then pointed down and fell, twisting slowly as he went, down through the hazes and the clouds and the slowly thickening weight and press of gas, down to where the temperature was suitable, where he levelled out and did something he had never done before; he opened the cover of the little gascraft and let the atmosphere in, let Nasqueron in, let it touch his naked human skin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Alarms were beeping and flashing and when he opened his eyes they stung in the dim orange light that seemed to shine from all around. He still had the gillfluid in his mouth and nose and throat and lungs, though now he was forced to try and breathe by himself, just his chest muscles against the pull of Nasqueron’s gravity field. He was still connected to the gascraft by the interface collar, too, and, when he could not raise himself up from the bed of shock-gel, he made the little arrowhead tip gradually towards its nose, so that he was propped three-quarters of the way towards a standing position.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Blood roared in his ears. His feet and legs protested at the weight as he was slowly forced down through the gel until he was partly standing on the far end of the cramped coffin shape that contained him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Now he could force himself away from the mould. He used his elbows, forcing himself forward. The stinging in his eyes was making them water. Tears at last. Shaking with the effort, he pulled at one sticky-slippy strand of the gillfluid where it disappeared into his right nostril, and opened his mouth, gulping some of the gas.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nasqueron smelled of rotten eggs.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked around, blinking the tears away as best he could, the interface collar sucking at his neck, trying to keep contact while he tried to look up and out. It was a muddy-looking old place, Nasqueron. Like a big bowl of beaten egg, with a load of liquid shit stirred in and little drops of blood spattered throughout. And sulphurous on the palate. He let the gillfluid snap back, filling his nose, granting him pure oxygen-rich air again, though the stench still lingered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was sweating, partly from the exertion, partly from the heat. Maybe he should have chosen to do this a bit further up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Now his nose was tingling, too, as well as his streaming eyes. He wondered if he could sneeze with the gillfluid inside him. Would it come splattering up out of him, some ghastly lung-vomit, ejected, left drooped over the side of the gascraft like some pale blue mass of seaweed, leaving him to gasp and choke and die?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He could hardly see because of the tears now, Nasqueron’s noxious skies finally drawing from him what he had not been able to express for himself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">All of them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The whole Sept.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d made the move to the Winter complex early. The warhead had fallen there, killing all of them: Slovius, Zab, Verpych, all his family, all the people he had grown up with, all those he had known and loved through his childhood and as he had grown, all the people who had made him whoever he now was, whatever he had been, until this moment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It had been quick. Instantaneous, indeed, but so what? They had felt no pain but they were dead, gone, beyond recall.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Only they were not beyond recall. He could not stop recalling, he could not cease bringing them back to life in his head, if only to apologise. He had suggested to Slovius that they get away from the Autumn House. He’d meant a neutral place, some hotel or university complex, but they’d gone to another of the Sept’s Seasonal Houses instead - a compromise. And that had killed them. He had killed them. His well-meant advice, his desire to care and protect, and to be known to have thought of this, had taken them all away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He thought of just letting the craft tip further over, beyond ninety degrees, letting himself fall out, jerked down by his own mass, hurtling him plummeting downwards into that great sucking breath of gas-giant gravity, the gillfluid wrenched from him, perhaps taking some parts of his lungs with it as it ripped away, tearing him apart and letting him fill the bloody, ragged remains with alien gas for his last scream - falsetto, like the voice you got when you sucked helium from a party balloon - as he plunged into the depths.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The signals and messages had finally caught up with them round about the time he’d been floating through the wreckage of Valseir’s wrecked study. All the shocked mailings, all the garbled queries, all the official notices, all the messages of support and sympathy, all the requests and follow-up signals asking for confirmation that he was still alive, all the news mentions, all the Ocula’s revised orders: they had all come through in a flood, a great tangled knot of incoming data, held up by the Shrievalty’s default secrecy, especially in a time of threat, the usual chaos of Dweller communications in general and the particular breakdown in the smooth running of signalling protocols transmission that always attended a Formal War, an effect always at its most extreme within the war zone itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dead, all dead. But then, not quite all dead (a Sept was no small thing, and reality was rarely quite so neat). Just as-good-as all. Five junior servants, on leave or errands, had survived, as had one of his second cousins and her infant son. That was all. Enough to make it not a clean break, however awful, sufficient so that he would be expected to keep going, provide leadership, be strong . . . all that easily said clichéd stuff. His mother, absent, might have survived, but she’d been killed too, in another attack - unrelated, it was supposed, just sheer bad luck - on the Cessorian habitat in the Kuiper belt where she’d been on a Retreat for the last half year.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He supposed he ought to be thankful that Jaal was still alive, that she had not been calling at the Winter House at the time of the attack. Instead he had a succession of alarmed, shocked, plaintive and then numb-sounding messages from her, the last few pleading for him to get in touch if he could, if he was alive, if he was somewhere in Nasqueron and could hear this or read this . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He had been listed as missing by the Shrievalty Ocula after the attack on Third Fury. Officially he still was. They hadn’t been sure that he and Colonel Hatherence were still alive until they’d received her relayed signal days later, and subsequently had thought it best to keep his survival a secret for the time being. His interview with the news service in Hauskip had complicated matters - however, this was already being denounced as a fake even without their intervention, and a degree of confusion had ensued. Listed as missing in action, he was still officially alive and so Chief Seer of Sept Bantrabal. That would not change for at least a year.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The situation in Ulubis system was no less desperate and the importance of what they had been asked to do had if anything increased with the latest hostile actions of the Invader/Beyonders.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even as it all came through, even as the signals downloaded into the gascraft’s memory, with all the codes intact, all the routings displayed, he kept thinking, <span class="italic">Maybe it’s all a hoax, maybe it’s all just some terrible mistake</span>. Even when he saw the news screenage of the still-smoking crater where the Winter House had been, in the rolling hills of Ualtus Great Valley, he had wanted to believe it wasn’t true; this was faked, all of it was faked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It had happened more or less at the same time as the bombardment of Third Fury. The tiny flash he had seen on the surface of ’glantine as they fell towards Nasqueron in the escaping drop ship: that had been the impact, that had been the instant of their deaths, that had been the very second in which he became alone. The earlier Shrievalty message, slipping through before the data jam that had kept them ignorant all these days and recording the organisation’s sympathy for his loss had been referring to this catastrophe as well, not just to the loss of life in Third Fury.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The wreckage of the drop ship had been found, in the upper Depths, the body of Master Technician Hervil Apsile within. It was as though nothing was to be left aside, nothing and nobody saved, nothing, almost nothing, left to him. Some servants he hardly knew and a second cousin he was moderately fond of, plus an infant he couldn’t even picture. And Jaal. But would that - could that - ever be the same now? He liked but did not love her, and was fairly sure she felt the same way. It would have been a good match, but after this he would be different, another person altogether, even if he did return from this idiot adventure, even if there was anything to return to, even if the coming war hadn’t destroyed or altered everything. And would her Sept want her to marry into a Sept that no longer existed? Where was the good match, the wise marriage there? Would even she want to, and if she still did, would it not be out of duty, out of sympathy, out of the feeling that their contract must still be honoured, no matter what? What a formula for future blame and bitterness that would be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was almost a comfort to realise that Jaal too would probably be lost to him. It was as though he was hanging over some great drop, about to fall, <span class="italic">destined</span> to fall, and the greatest pain came from the act of still hanging on, fingers scraping, nails tearing. Let go of this one last thing to cling to, and the fall itself would at least be painless.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He wasn’t going to kill himself. It was grimly good to know he could do it, but he wouldn’t. From a purely practical point of view, he was fairly certain that Hatherence had followed him, using her esuit’s military capabilities to hide herself from his gascraft’s senses. She’d try to stop him. It could get undignified, and she might even succeed. If he really wanted to kill himself, he was sure there were easier ways. Just heading deeper into the war zone and powering hard straight for a Dreadnought should do the job.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And it would be too easy. It would be selfish. It would be the end to this terrible, gnawing feeling of guilt, a line drawn under that, and he didn’t think that he deserved such an easy way out. He felt guilty? So feel guilty. He had meant no harm - quite the opposite - he’d just been wrong. Feeling guilty was stupid. It was understandable, but it was stupid, just beside the point. They were dead and he was alive. His actions might well have led directly to their deaths, but he hadn’t killed them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">What was left? Revenge, maybe. Though who to blame? If it really had been Beyonders, that made his old treachery (or principled, self-sacrificing stand, depending) look foolish somehow. He still despised the Mercatoria, hated the whole vicious, cretinous, vacuously self-important, sentience-hating system, and he’d never had any illusions about the unalloyed niceness of the Beyonders or any other large group, or thought that a struggle against the Mercatoria would be other than prolonged, painful and bloody. He’d always known that his own end might be painful and long-drawn-out - he would do everything he could to make sure it wasn’t, but sometimes there was just nothing you could do. He had also realised that innocents died just as filthily and in equally great numbers in a just war as they did in an unjust one, and had known that war was to be avoided at almost all costs just because it magnified mistakes, exaggerated errors, but still he’d hoped there would somehow be an elegance about his involvement in the struggle against the Mercatoria, a degree of gloriousness, a touch of the heroic.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Instead: muddle, confusion, stupidity, insane waste, pointless pain, misery and mass death - all the usual stuff of war, affecting him as it might affect anybody else, without any necessary moral reason, without any justice and even without any vindictiveness, just through the ghastly, banal working-out of physics, chemistry, biochemistry, orbital mechanics and the shared nature of sentient beings existing and contending.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Perhaps he had brought it all down upon them. Never mind advising Slovius to get away from the Autumn House: his delve, his famous delve, the action of meeting Valseir and trading information might have produced all this. It might all be his fault. Taking all he’d been told at face value, it was.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He tried to laugh, but the gillfluid filling his mouth and throat and lungs wouldn’t let him, not properly. ‘Oh, come on then,’ he tried to say into the gassy skies of Nasqueron (it came out as a hopeless mumble), ‘show me it’s all a sim, prove the Cessoria’s right. End run. Game over. Lift me out.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Still all just a mumble, a gurgling somewhere down in his throat as he half stood, half lay there in his coffin-shaped alcove in the little hovering gascraft, poised within the gas-giant’s atmosphere at a place where a human could expose themselves to the elements and not die too quickly, if they had something to breathe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Revenge was a poor way out too, he thought through his tears. It was human nature, it was creat nature, it would be in the nature of almost any being capable of feeling angry and injured, but it was nearly as poor a way out as suicide. Self-serving, self-centred, selfish. Yes, if he was set in front of whoever had ordered the lobbing of a nuke at a house complex full of unarmed, unwarned civilians, he’d be tempted to kill them if he could, but it would not bring the dead back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He never would have the opportunity, of course - again, reality scarcely ever worked that neatly - but if, in theory, he was presented with the chance, the fabled they’re-tied-to-a-chair-and-you’ve-got-a-gun scenario, able to hurt or kill whoever had killed most of those he’d loved, he might do it. There was an argument that it would only make him as bad as them, but then he knew that in a way he was already just as bad as them. The only moral reason for doing it would be to rid the world, the galaxy, the universe of one self-evidently bad person. As though there would ever be a shortage, as though that wouldn’t just leave the same niche for another.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And it would be a military machine, a hierarchy involved here, anyway. The responsibility would almost certainly diffuse out from whoever - or whatever group - had drawn up the relevant strategy through to whoever had given some probably vague order down to whoever had drawn up the general and specific targeting criteria, on down to some schmuck grunt or thoughtless technician who’d pressed a button or tapped a screen or thought-clicked an icon floating in a holo tank. And doubtless that individual would be a product of the usual hammer-subtle military induction and indoctrination process, breaking the individual down and building them back up again into a usefully obedient semi-automatic asset, sentimental towards their closest comrades, loyal only to some cold code. And, oh, how utterly sure you would have to be that they really were responsible in the first place, that you weren’t being fooled by whoever had arranged all this tying-to-a-chair stuff and equipped you with a gun in the first place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Maybe automatics had slotted in the final target programming. Was he supposed to track down the programmer too and tie him up with whoever had given the attack-authorisation or dreamed up the whole wizzo plan for visiting Ulubis in the first place?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">If it had really been Beyonders, it might have been an AI which was responsible for the deed, for who-knew-what reason. Why, he’d have to find it, turn the durn thing off. Though wasn’t the Mercatoria’s murderous attitude to AIs one of the reasons he hated it so much?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And maybe, of course, it had all been their mistake and his fault. Perhaps they’d thought they were going to hit an empty house and only his idiot advice, his meddling, had filled it with people. How to apportion the blame there?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His eyes were bad now, like sand had been thrown in them. He couldn’t really see anything, the tears were so thick. (He could still see via the collar, which was a strange experience, the tipped, clear view of the arrowhead’s senses overlaid on his body’s own.) He couldn’t kill himself. He had to go on, see what could be done, pay tribute, try to make up, try to leave the place even fractionally better than he’d found it, try to do whatever good he might be capable of.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He waited for the Truth to kick in, for the sim-run to end, and when it didn’t - as he’d known it wouldn’t but had almost hoped it would - he felt bitter, resigned and grimly amused all at once.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He told the little gascraft to tip back and seal him in again. The arrowhead angled backwards, closing the canopy and enveloping him once more, the shock-gel already moving to cushion and cosset him, tendrils of salve within it starting to heal and repair his flesh and soothe his weeping eyes. He thought the machine did it all with something like relief, but knew that was a lie. The relief was his.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, opinions differ as opinions should. Always have, do and will. Might we have been bred? Who knows? Maybe we were pets. Perhaps professional prey. Maybe we were ornaments, palace entertainers, whipping beings, galaxy-changing seed-machines gone wrong (these are some of our myths). Maybe our makers disappeared, or we overthrew them (another myth - vainglorious, overly flattering - I distrust it). Maybe these makers were some proto-plasmatics? This, must be said, a pervasive one, a tenacious trope. Why plasmatics? Why would beings of the flux - stellar or planetary, no matter - wish to make something like us, so long ago? We have no idea. Yet the rumour persists.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All we know is that we are here and we have been here for ten billion years or more. We come and we go and we live our lives at different rates, generally slower as we get older, as you good people have seen within these walls, but beyond that, why are we? What are we for? What is our point? We have no idea. You’ll forgive me; these questions seem somehow more important when applied to us, to Dwellers, because we do seem - well, if not <span class="italic">designed</span>, certainly, as one might say, <span class="italic">prone</span> to persisting, given to hanging about.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No disrespect, do understand, but the selfsame questions applied to Quick, to humans or even - like-species apologies begged, dear colonel, accept - to oerileithe, have not the same force because you do not have our track record, our provenance, our sheer cussed, gratuitous, god-denying abidance. Who knows? Maybe one day you will! After all, the universe is still young, for all our shared egocentricity, our handed-down certitude of culmination, and perhaps when the Final Chronicles are written by our unknowable ultimate inheritors they will record that the Dwellers lasted a mere dozen billion years or so in the first heady flush of the universe’s infancy before they faded away to nothing, while the oerileithe and humans, those bywords for persistence, those doughty elongueurs, those synonyms for civilisational endurance, lasted two and three hundred billion years respectively, or whatever. <span class="italic">Then</span> the same questions might be asked of you: Why? What for? To what end? And - who can say! - perhaps for you, such being the case, there will be an answer. Better yet, one that makes sense.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘For now, though, we alone are stuck with such awkward challenges. Everybody else seems to come and go, and that appears natural, that is to be expected, that is the given: species appear, develop, blossom, flourish, expand, coast, shrink and fade. Cynics would say: ha! just nature, is all - no credit to claim, no blame to take, but I say huzzah! Good for all for trying, for taking part, for being such sports. But we? Us? No, we’re different. We seem cursed, doomed, marked out to outstay our welcome, linger in a niche that could as well fit many - yes, many! - others, making everybody else feel uncomfortable by our just still being here when by rights we should have shuffled off with our once-contemporaries long ago. It’s an embarrassment, I don’t mind admitting. I’m amongst friends, I can say these things. And anyway, I’m just an old mad Dweller, a tramp, an itinerant, a floatful plodder from place to place, worthy of nothing but contempt and handouts, both if I’m lucky, worse if I’m not. I try your patience. Forgive me. I get to talk to so few apart from the voices I make up.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The speaker was an off-sequence Dweller of Cuspian age called Oazil. To be off-sequence was to have declared oneself - or, sometimes, to have been declared by one’s peers - uninterested in or apart from the usual steady progression of age and seniority that Dweller society assumed its citizens would follow. It was not by itself a state of disgrace - it was often compared to a person becoming a monk or a nun - though if it had been imposed on rather than chosen by a Dweller it was certainly a sign that they might later become an Outcast, and physically ejected from their home planet, a sanction which, given the relaxed attitude Dwellers displayed to both interstellar travel times and spaceship-construction quality control, was effectively a sentence of somewhere between several thousand years solitary confinement, and death.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Oazil was an itinerant, a tramp, a wanderer. He had entirely lost contact with a family he claimed to have anyway forgotten all details of, had no real friends to speak of, belonged to no clubs, sodalities, societies, leagues or groups and had no permanent home.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He lived, he’d told them, in his carapace and his clothes, which were tattered and motley but raggedly impressive, decorated with carefully painted panels depicting stars, planets and moons, preserved flowers from dozens of CloudPlant species and the polished carbon bones and gleaming, socketed skulls of various miniature gas-giant fauna. It was a slightly larger-scale and more feral collection of what Dwellers called life charms compared to the sort of stuff Valseir had worn save when there was some sort of formal event to attend.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When Fassin had first seen the Dweller tramp it had even occurred to him that Oazil was Valseir in disguise, come back in some attempted secrecy to taunt them all, see how they would treat a poor itinerant before revealing himself as the true owner of the house come to reclaim his lost estate. But Valseir and Oazil looked quite different. Oazil was bulkier, his carapace fractionally less symmetrical, his markings less intricate, his voice far deeper and his quota of remaining vanes and limbs quite different too. Most marked of all, Oazil’s carapace was much darker than Valseir’s. The two were of roughly similar age - Oazil would have been slightly junior to Valseir had he still been on-sequence: a Cuspian-baloan or Cuspian-nompar to Valseir’s Cuspian-choal - but he looked much older, darker and more weather-beaten, almost as dark as Jundriance, who was ten times his age but had spent much of his life as a scholar in slow-time, not wandering the atmosphere exposed to the elements.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Oazil towed behind him a little float-trailer - shaped like a small Dweller and similarly bedecked - in which he carried a few changes of apparel, some sentimentally precious objects and a selection of gifts which he had made, usually carved from OxyTreeCloud roots. He had presented one of these, shaped to resemble the bubble house itself, to Nuern, to pass on to Jundriance when next he left his depths of slow academe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nuern had not looked especially impressed to receive this small token. However, Oazil claimed that Valseir’s house had been a stopping-off point for him during his peregrinations for the last, oh, fifty or sixty thousand years or so. And there was anyway, especially away from cities, a tradition of hospitality towards wanderers that it would be profoundly kudos-sacrificing to ignore, certainly when there were other guests around to witness the insult.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Will you stay long, sir?’ Nuern asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, will you?’ asked Livilido.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, no, I’ll be gone tomorrow,’ Oazil told the younger Dweller. ‘This is, I’m sure, a fine house still, though of course I am sorry to hear that my old friend is no more. However, I become awkward when I spend too long in one place, and houses, though not as terrifying to me as cities, provoke in me a kind of restlessness. I cannot wait to be away when I am near a house, no matter how pleasant its aspect or welcoming the hosts.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were outside on one of the many balconies girdling the house living spaces. They had originally convened for a morning meal to welcome Oazil in the net-hung dining space. But the old Dweller had seemed uncomfortable from the start, edgy and a-twitch, and before the first course was over he had asked, embarrassed and plaintive, if he might dine outside, perhaps beyond a window they would open so that they could still converse face to face. He suffered from a kind of claustrophobia brought on by countless millennia spent wandering the vast unceilinged skies, and felt uncomfortable enclosed like this. Nuern and Livilido had swiftly ordered their younger servants to strike table and set the meal up on the nearest balcony.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d all gone outside, and - after voluminous apologies for seeming to force his will upon them - Oazil had settled down, enjoyed his meal, and, subsequent to sampling some aura-grains and timbre-trace from the narcotics in the table’s centrepiece - modelled on a globular university city - he had relaxed sufficiently to share with them all his thoughts on Dweller origins. It was a favourite after-meal topic with Dwellers, and so one there was effectively nothing original to say concerning, though, to give Oazil some credit, the subject had been his academic speciality before he’d slipped the moorings of scholastic life and set float upon the high skies of wander.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence asked the old Dweller his thoughts on whether his species had always been unable to experience pain, or had had this bred out of them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah! If we only knew! I am fascinated that you ask the question, for it is one that I believe is of the utmost importance in the determining of what our species really means in the universe . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin, resting lightly in a cushioned dent across the ceremonial table from the old wanderer, found his attention slipping. It seemed to do this a lot now. Perhaps a dozen Nasqueron days had elapsed since the news of the Winter House’s destruction. He had spent almost all that time in the various libraries, searching for anything that might lead to their goal, the (to him, at least) increasingly mythical-seeming third volume of the work that he had taken from here over two hundred years ago and which had, supposedly, led to so much that had happened since. He looked, he searched, he trawled and combed and scanned, but so often, even when it seemed to him that he was concentrating fully, he’d find that he’d spent the last few minutes just staring into space, seeing in his mind’s eye some aspect of the Sept and family life that was now gone, recalling an inconsequential conversation from decades ago, some at-the-time so-what? exchange that he would not have believed he’d ever have remembered, let alone have found brought to mind now, when they were all gone and he was in such a far and different place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He felt the welling of tears in his eyes sometimes. The shock-gel drew them gently away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sometimes he thought again of suicide, and found himself longing, as though for a lost love or a treasured, vanished age, for the will, the desire, the sheer determination to end things that would have made killing himself a realistic possibility. Instead, suicide seemed as pointless and futile as everything else in life. You needed desire, the desire for death, to kill yourself. When you seemed to have no desire, no emotions or drives of any sort left - just their shadows, habits - killing oneself became as impossible as falling in love.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked up from the books and scrolls, the fiches and crystals, the etched diamond leaf and glowing screens and holos, and wondered what the point of anything was. He knew the standard answers, of course: people - all species, all species-types - wanted to live, wanted comfort, to be free from threat, needed energy in some form - whether it was as direct as absorbed sunlight or as at-a-remove as meat - desired to procreate, were curious, wanted enlightenment or fame and/or success and/or any of the many forms of prosperity, but - ultimately - to what end? People died. Even the immortal died. Gods died.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Some had faith, religious belief, even in this prodigiously, rampantly physically self-sufficient age, even in the midst of this universal, abundant clarity of godlessness and godlack, but such people seemed, in his experience, no less prone to despair, and their faith a liability even in its renunciation, just one more thing to lose and mourn.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">People went on, they lived and struggled and insisted on living even in hopelessness and pain, desperate not to die, to cling to life regardless, as if it was the most precious thing, when all it had ever brought them, was bringing them and ever would bring them was more hopelessness, more pain.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Everybody seemed to live as though things were always just about to get better, as though any bad times were just about to end, any time now, but they were usually wrong. Life ground on. Sometimes to the good, but often towards ill and always in the direction of death. Yet people acted as though death was just the biggest surprise - My, who put that there? Maybe that was the right way to treat it, of course. Maybe the sensible attitude was to act as though there had been nothing before one came to consciousness, and nothing would exist after one’s death, as though the whole universe was built around one’s own individual awareness. It was a working hypothesis, a useful half-truth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But did that mean that the urge to live was the result of some sort of illusion? Was the reality, in fact, that nothing mattered and people were fools to think that anything did? Were the choices either despair, the rejection of reason for some idiot faith, or a sort of defensive solipsism?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir might have had something useful to say on the matter, Fassin thought. But then, he was dead too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked at Oazil and wondered if this self-proclaimed wanderer really had known the dead Cuspian whose house this had been. Or was he just a chancer, a blow-hard, a fantasist and liar?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Thinking like this, circling round his studied despair, Fassin only half-listened to the old Dweller with his theories about gas-giant fauna development and his tales of wandering.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Oazil told how once he had circumnavigated the South Tropical Band without seeing another Dweller in all those hundred and forty thousand kilometres, how he had once fallen in with a gang of Adolescent Sculpture Pirates, semi-renegades who seeded public RootCloud and AmmoniaSluice forests, him becoming their figurehead, mascot, totem, and how, many millennia ago in the little-travelled wastes of the Southern Polar Region, he had wandered into a vast warren of empty CloudTunnel. (The work of a troop of rogue Tunnel-building machines since disappeared? An artwork? The lost prototype for a new kind of city? He didn’t know - nobody had ever heard of this place, this thing.) He was lost inside this vast tree, this giant lung, this colossal root system of a labyrinth for a thousand years, exiting eleven-twelfths starved and nearly mad. He had reported the find and people had looked for it but it had never been found again. Most people thought he’d imagined it all, but he had not. <span class="italic">They</span> believed him, did they not?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The tapping noise was there again. He had been vaguely aware of it but had ignored it, not even getting as far as dismissing it as some function of the house’s plumbing or differential expansion or reaction to some brief current in the surrounding gas. It had stopped after a while - he had half-noticed that, too, though still thought no more about it. Now it was there again, and slightly louder.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was in Library Three, one of the inner libraries, speed-reading through the contents of a sub-library that Valseir appeared to have picked up as part of a job lot untold ages ago. From the earliest date that anybody had bothered to note, this stuff had been lying around uncalled-up and unread for thirty millennia, dating from an era several different species of Slow Seers ago, long before humans had come to Ulubis. Fassin suspected this was traded material, data - second-hand, third-hand, who knew how many-hand - dredged from who knew where, possibly auto-translated (it certainly read like it whenever he dipped into the text itself, to make sure that the contents were what the abstracts claimed), bundled and presented and handed over to the Dwellers of Nasqueron by some long-superseded (possibly even long-extinct) species of Seer in return for - presumably - still older information. He wondered at what point most of the data the Dwellers held would become traded data, and if that point had already been reached. He was not the first Seer to think of this and, thanks to the absolute opaqueness of the Dwellers’ records, he would certainly not be the last.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The volumes he was checking were mostly composed of stories concerning the romantic adventures and philosophical musings of some group of Stellar Field Liners, though they were either much-translated or the work of not just another species but another species-type altogether. They seemed fanciful, anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The tapping wasn’t going to go away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked up from the screen to the round skylight set in the ceiling. Library Three, though now surrounded and surmounted by other spheres, had once been on the upper outskirts of the house and had a generous expanse of diamond leaf at its crown, though nowadays - even had the house been situated in less gloomy regions - it would let in little natural light.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was something small and pale out there. When Fassin looked up the tapping stopped and the thing waved. It looked like a Dweller infant, a pet-child. Fassin watched it waving for a while, then went back to the screen and the not especially feasible exploits of the S’Liners. The tapping started again. He felt himself attempt to sigh inside his little gascraft. He stopped the screen scroll and lifted out of the dent-seat, rising to the centre of the ceiling.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was indeed a Dweller child: a rather elongated, deformed-looking one, to human eyes more like a squid than a manta ray. It was dressed in rags and decorated with a few pathetic-looking life charms. Fassin had never seen an infant wearing clothes or decorations. It was oddly, maturely dark for one so young. It pointed in at what looked like some sort of catch or lock on the side of one of the skylight’s hexagonal panes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at the curious infant for a while. It kept pointing at the catch. There had been no sign of pet-children round the house in all the time they’d been here. This one looked entirely like it might belong to Oazil, but he had not displayed any earlier, and hadn’t mentioned owning one. The child was still indicating the pane’s lock. It started to mime pressing and twisting and pulling motions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin opened the pane and let the creature in. It flipped inside, made a sign that was probably meant to be the Dweller equivalent of ‘Shh!’ and floated towards him, curling and cupping its body so that it formed a sickle shape, just a metre away from the prow of the arrowhead craft. Then, on its signal skin, now shielded from sight in all directions save that Fassin was watching from, it spelled out,</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">OAZIL: MEET ME 2KM STRAIGHT DOWN, HOUR 5. RE. VALSEIR.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It waited till he light-signalled back OK, then it sped out the way it had come, one slim tentacle staying behind after the rest of it had exited just long enough to pull the ceiling pane shut after it. It disappeared into the night-time gloom between the dark library globes outside.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at the time. Just before hour Four. He went back to his studies, finding nothing, thinking about nothing, until just before five, when he went back to Library Twenty-One and slipped out through the secret doorway again. He dropped the two thousand metres down through the slowly increasing heat and pressure and met the old Dweller Oazil, complete with his float-trailer. Oazil signalled,</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin Taak?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What did Valseir once compare the Quick to? In some detail, if you please.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Why?&gt;</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old Dweller sent nothing for some time, then, - You might guess, little one. Or do this just because I ask. To humour an old Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin waited a while before answering. - Clouds, he sent, eventually. - Clouds above one of our worlds. We come and we go and we are as nothing compared to the landscape beneath, just vapour compared to implacable rock, which lasts seemingly beyond lasting and is always there long after the clouds of the day or the clouds of the season have long gone, and yet other clouds will always be there, the next day and the next and the next, and the next season and the next year and for as long as the mountains themselves last, and the wind and the rain wear away mountains in time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm, Oazil sent, sounding distracted. - Mountains. Curious idea. I have never seen a mountain.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Nor ever will, I imagine. Do you want me to add any more? I don’t think I recall much else.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No, that will not be necessary.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Then?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Valseir is alive, the old Dweller said. - He sends his regards.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Alive?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- There is a GasClipper regatta at the C-2 Storm Ultra-Violet 3667, beginning in seventeen days’ time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That’s in the war zone, isn’t it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The tournament was arranged long before the hostilities were first mooted and so has been cleared with the Formal War Marshals. A special dispensation. Be there, Fassin Taak. He will find you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old Dweller roted forward a metre, taking up the slack on the float-trailer’s traces. - Farewell, Seer Taak, he signalled. - Remember me to our mutual friend, if you’d be so kind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He turned and floated away into the deep hot darkness. In a few moments he was lost to most passive senses. Fassin waited until there was no sign of him at all, then rose slowly back up to the house.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Ah, Fassin, I understand commiserations are in order,’ Y’sul said, floating up to the bubble house’s reception balcony from the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>. Nuern, Fassin and Hatherence had watched the ship motor out of the dim haze, hearing its engines long before they’d seen it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Your sympathy is noted,’ Fassin told Y’sul. He’d got Hatherence to call the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> the day before and order it back from its hunting patrol. The little ship returned with a modest number of trophies strung from its rigging: various julmicker bladders, bobbing like grisly balloons on sticks, three gas-drying RootHugger hides, the heads of a brace of gracile Tumblerines and - patently the most prized, mounted above the craft’s nose - a Dweller Child carcass, already gutted and stretched wide on a frame so that it looked like some slightly grotesque figurehead, flying just ahead of the ship. Fassin had sensed the colonel’s esuit rolling fractionally back when she’d realised what the new addition to the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>’s nose actually was.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What is your state of mind, Fassin, now that you have lost so many of your family?’ Y’sul asked, coming to a stop in front of the Seer. ‘Are you decided to return to your own people?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My state of mind is . . . calm. I may still be in shock, I suppose.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shock?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Look it up. I have not decided to return to my own people yet. There are almost none to return to. We are, however, finished here. I wish to return to Munueyn.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d told the colonel that morning that he’d discovered something and they needed to leave.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What have you discovered, major? May I see it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll tell you later.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see. So where next are we bound?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Back to Munueyn,’ he’d lied.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Munueyn? Our captain will be pleased,’ Y’sul said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They left that evening. Nuern and Livilido seemed relaxed, positively cheered, that they were departing. Y’sul had returned with news of the war, in which two important Dreadnought actions had already taken place, resulting, in one engagement alone, in the loss of five Dreadnoughts and nearly a hundred deaths. The Zone forces were retreating in two volumes at least and the Belt certainly had the upper grasp at the moment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin and Hatherence recorded short messages of gratitude for Jundriance to read at his leisure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nuern asked them if they wanted to take any of the books or other works from the house.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, thank you,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I found this humorous thesaurus,’ the colonel said, holding up a small diamond-leaf book. ‘I’d like this.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Be our guest,’ Nuern told her. ‘Anything else? Diamond-based works like that will burn up in a few decades when the house has dropped further into the heat. Take all you want.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Over-kind. This alone is most sufficient.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘The GasClipper regatta?’ Captain Slyne said. He scratched his mantle. ‘I thought you wanted to go back to Munueyn?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There was no reason to let our hosts know where we were really heading,’ Fassin told Slyne.</span></div></body></html>
