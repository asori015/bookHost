<div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You are suspicious of them?’ Y’sul asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just no reason to trust them,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The regatta takes place around the Storm Ultra-Violet 3667, between Zone C and Belt 2,’ the colonel said. ‘Starting in sixteen days. Have we time to get there, captain?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in Slyne’s cabin, a fairly grand affair of flickering wall-screens and antique furniture, the ceiling hung with ancient ordnance: guns, blaster tubes and crossbows all swaying gently as the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> powered away at half-throttle from Valseir’s old house. So far Fassin had told Hatherence where they were really going, though not why.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne let himself tilt, looking as though he was about to fall over. He did some more mantle scratching. ‘I think so. I’d better change course, then.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Leave the course change for a little longer, would you?’ Fassin asked. They were only a half-hour away from the bubble house. ‘Though you might go to full speed.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Have to anyway, if we’re to get to that Storm in time,’ Slyne said, turning and manipulating a holo cube floating over his halo-shaped desk. The largest screen, just in front of him, lit up with a chart of the volume and quickly became covered in gently curved lines and scrolling figure boxes. Slyne peered at this display for a few moments, then announced: ‘Full speed, we can be there in eighteen days. Best I can do.’ Slyne gripped a large, polished-looking handle sitting prominently on his desk and pushed it, with a degree of obvious relish, if also a little embarrassment, to its limit. The tone of the ship’s engines altered and the vessel began to accelerate gradually.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We might contact Munueyn and hire a faster ship,’ Y’sul suggested. ‘Have it rendezvous with the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> en route and transfer to it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne rocked back, staring at the older Dweller with patterns of betrayal and horror (non-mild) spreading across his signal skin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eighteen days will have to do, captain,’ Fassin told Slyne. ‘I don’t think we need be there for the very start of the tournament. ’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How long do these competitions last, in generality?’ Hatherence asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne tore his gaze from an unconcerned-looking Y’sul and said, ‘Ten or twelve days, usually. They might cut this one a little short because of the War. We’ll be there in time for most of it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good,’ Fassin said. ‘Stay on your current course for another half-hour, if you please, captain. Turn for the Storm then.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne looked happier. ‘Consider it done.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">Slyne took advantage of a WindRiver, a brief-lived ribbon of still faster current within the vast, wide jet stream of the whole rotating Zone, and they made good time. They were challenged twice by war craft but allowed to continue on their way, and slipped through a mine net, a wall of dark lace thrown across the sky, dotted with warheads. Dreadnought-catcher, nothing to worry them, Slyne assured them. They had, oh, tens of metres to spare on almost every side.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screwburster <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> got to very near the bottom of the Storm called Ultra-Violet 3667 within sixteen days, arriving more or less as the regatta began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Keep clipped on! Could get a bit rough!’ Y’sul yelled, then repeated the warning as a signal, in case they hadn’t heard.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin and Hatherence had come up on deck when the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> had started bucking and heaving even more than usual. The gas around them, darker even than it had been at Valseir’s house, though less dense and hot, was fairly shrieking through the ship’s vestigial rigging. Ribbons and streaks, just seen coiling briefly round the whole vessel, were then torn away again as the ship plunged into another great boiling mass of cloud.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The human and the oerileithe, still within the relative calmness of the companionway shelter, exchanged glances, then quickly put the crude-looking harnesses on. The colonel’s fitted well over her esuit. Fassin’s tied tight enough but looked messy, not designed for his alien shape. Slyne had insisted that everybody should wear the things whenever they went on deck while the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> was at full speed, even though both Hatherence and Fassin - in the unlikely event that they were somehow blown off the deck - could easily have caught up with the ship under their own power.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What’s going on?’ Hatherence shouted as they neared Y’sul, clinging to the rails near the bow harpoon gun.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Going to shoot the storm!’ Y’sul bellowed back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That sounds dangerous!’ Hatherence yelled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, assuredly!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, what does it entail, exactly?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Punching through the storm wall,’ Y’sul shouted. ‘Tackling the rim winds. Should be spectacular!’ Ahead, a great dark wall of tearing, whirling cloud could be glimpsed beyond the tatters and scraps of gas that the ship was stabbing its way through. Jagged lines of lightning pulsed across this vast cliff like veins of quicksilver.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were still making maximum speed towards the wall, which seemed to stretch as far to each side as they could see, and up for ever. Downwards was a more swirling mass of even darker gas, boiling like something cooking in a cauldron. The wind picked up, thrumming the rails and rigging and aerials like an enormous instrument. The <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> shuddered and buzzed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Time to get below, suspect,’ Hatherence shouted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A julmicker bladder blew off a nearby railing - it looked like it had been the last one left - smacked Y’sul across his starboard side and was instantly lost to the shrieking gale. ‘Could be,’ Y’sul agreed. ‘After you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They watched from the ship’s armoured storm deck, crowded in with Slyne beneath a blister of thick diamond set at midships, looking out across the deck and watching the <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>’s nose plunge into the storm like a torpedo thrown at a horizontal waterfall of ink. The ship groaned, started to spin, and they were all thrown against each other. They disappeared into the wall of darkness. The <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> shook and leapt like a Dweller child on the end of a harpoon line.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Slyne whooped, pulling on levers and whirling wheels. Stuck in the far reaches of the ovaloid space, Slyne’s pet-children whimpered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This entirely necessary?’ Fassin asked Y’sul.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Doubt it!’ the Dweller said. A big flat board covered in studs above Slyne started to light up. In the darkness, it was quite bright.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence pointed at it as dozens more of the studs lit. ‘What’s that?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Damage-control indicators!’ Slyne said, still working levers and spinning wheels. They all rose to the ceiling as the ship dropped sharply, then crashed back down again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thought it might be,’ Hatherence said. She was thrown hard against Fassin in a violent turn, and apologised.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When the glare started to get too distracting, Slyne turned the damage-control board off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the worst of the turbulence, one of Slyne’s pet-children threw itself at its master and had to be torn off and smacked unconscious before being thrown into a locker. It was unclear whether it had been desperately seeking comfort or attacking.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul was sick. Fassin had never seen a Dweller be sick.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Stuck to the ceiling again, coated in a greasy film of vomit, Slyne cursing as he tried to keep hold of the controls, his pet-children keening from all sides, somebody mumbled, ‘Fuck, we’re going to die.’ They all denied responsibility afterwards.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Poaflias</span> burst out of the torrent of storm cloud into a vast and hazy calm and started to drop like a lump of iron. Slyne drew in gas to whoop but caught some of Y’sul’s earlier output and just spluttered. Coughing and retching and cursing Y’sul’s lineage to some point only shortly after the Big Bang, he got the ship level and under control, contacted Regatta Control and limped - the ship had lost all its rigging, railings and four of its six engines - to the Lower Marina and a berth in a Storm Repair Facility.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Looking up, into the colossal bowl of the circling storm and on into the haze and the star-specked sky beyond, tiny shapes could be seen, slow-circling against the brassy glare of light.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>- The pick-up fleet and relaying craft are all in orbit, Hatherence told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in a steep-pitched, multi-tiered viewing gallery packed with Dwellers. Protected by carbon ribs ready to be explosively deployed should a competition craft come too close - and attached to the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>, a klick-long Blimper riding just inside the storm-wall boundary - the gallery was a relatively safe place to watch GasClipper races. Giant banner screens could scroll up on either side of the fan of dent-seats to provide highlights of other races and relay events too distant to witness directly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The pick-up <span class="italic">fleet</span>? Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That is as it was described to me, Hatherence said, settling into her seat alongside his. Dwellers around them were staring at them, seemingly fascinated by their alienness. Y’sul had gone off to meet an old friend. While he was with them, Dwellers only glanced at Fassin and Hatherence now and again. With him gone, they stared shamelessly. They had both got used to it, and Fassin was confident that, if Valseir was here and looking for him, he wouldn’t have too difficult a job finding him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How big a fleet? Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not sure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There were hundreds of accommodation and spectator Blimpers within the storm’s vast eye, scores of competing GasClippers and support vessels, plus dozens of media and ancillary craft, not to mention a ceremonial - and War-neutral - Dreadnought, the <span class="italic">Puisiel</span>. This was decked out with multitudinous bunting, lines of ancient signal flags and festoons of Dweller-size BalloonFlowers, just so that there’d be no possibility of anyone mistaking it for a Dreadnought taking part in the greater and fractionally more serious competition taking place beyond the Storm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The side screens lit up and they watched some early action from a race which had taken place the day before. Around them, a thousand Dwellers hooted and roared and laughed, threw food, made spoken kudos bets that they would later deny or inflate accordingly, and traded insults.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Any other news from outside? Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Our orders remain as they were. There have been more semi-random attacks throughout the system. Nothing on the same scale as the assaults on the Seer assets earlier. The defensive preparations continue apace. Manufacturers continue to make heroic efforts. The people continue to make great but willing sacrifice. Morale remains most high. Though, unofficially, people would seem to be growing more frightened. Some rioting. Deep-space monitors have picked up still ambiguous traces of a great fleet approaching from the direction of the E-5 Disconnect.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How great?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Great enough to be bad.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Much rioting?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not much rioting.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Blimper powered up, distantly revving its engines. A ragged cheer resounded around them as the Dwellers realised things were about to start happening.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, major, the colonel sent, signal strength low in the clattering hubbub of noise. - We are finally off the ship <span class="italic">Poaflias</span>, we are alone, I think it unlikely we can be overheard, and I have built up an extravagant desire to know quite why we are here. Unless you have, in the course, perhaps, of your studies, discovered that you are an insatiable fan of GasClippering.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- According to Oazil, Valseir is alive.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel was silent for a while. Then she sent, - You tell me so, do you?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course, Oazil may be mad or deluded or a fantasist or just a mischief-maker, but from what he said he knew Valseir, or had at least been instructed by Valseir on what to ask me to make sure I really was who I claimed to be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I see. So, his turning up at the house was not chance?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I suspect he’d been keeping a watch on it. Or somebody had, waiting for us - for me - to turn up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And he told you to come here?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- He did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And then?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Valseir will find me.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another cheer went up as the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> began to pick up speed, becoming part of a small fleet of similar spectator craft flocking through the gas towards the starting grid of GasClippers arranged a couple of kilometres ahead. This would be a short race, only lasting an hour or so, with turns around buoys set in the StormWall. The races would grow longer and more gruelling as the meet progressed, culminating in a last epic struggle all the way round the vast storm’s inner surface.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So Valseir knew you were or might be looking for him, and had put in place arrangements to . . . Hmm. That is interesting. Any contact so far?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not yet. But now you know why we’re here.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You will keep me informed?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes. Though you will understand if I have to go off by myself at some point, I hope. Your presence might make Valseir, or whoever, nervous.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Blimper picked up more speed, still heading towards the storm-inward side of the starting grid. The slipstream started to blow away balloons and trays not secured.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Nervous? You think this is all that . . . serious?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What do you think?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I think Oazil is probably one or several of the things you thought he might be. However, we are here now and if he was telling the truth no doubt you will be contacted. Of course, the other possibility is that we might have been getting close to something of interest back at Valseir’s house and this was simply a method of getting us out of the way. What exactly did Oazil say to you?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had kept a record of the conversation he’d had with the wandering Dweller, deep beneath the house. He signalled it across to Hatherence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The fleet of spectator craft passed by the starting grid like an unruly flock of fat birds. Another great cheer sounded. The GasClippers stayed on the starting plane, awaiting their own signal.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Still, little enough to go on, major, Hatherence told him. - You should have shared this with me earlier and let me decide on the correct course of action. I may have been overly indulgent with you. Your loss is still something I appreciate, of course. However, I fear I might have been guilty of dereliction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I won’t report you if you don’t, Fassin sent, without humour.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The GasClippers - the larger, plural-crewed versions of the single-Dweller StormJammers - were sharp, angular-looking things, all jag-sails, keel-lode and high-gallants. Fifty metres long - fifty metres in most directions - bristling with glittering sails like enormous blades, they looked like the result of some monstrous permanent magnet being thrown into a hopper full of exotic edged weapons. Pennant sails carried identifying marks, little flowers of colour within the silvery blades, all bright beneath the glittering point of light that was Ulubis.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was not possible to sail in a single medium. True sailing required a keel (or something like one) in one medium, and sails (or something like them) in another. In a single great stream of gas, you could not sail: you flew. On the edges of two streams, the boundary between a zone moving in one direction and a belt moving in the other, you could, in theory, sail, if you could build a ship big enough. The Dwellers had tried to build ships on that scale that would stay together. They had failed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Instead, StormJammers and GasClippers exploited the titanic magnetic fields that most gas-giant planets possessed. Flux lines were their water, the place where their steadying keels lay. With a colossal magnetic field trying to move them along one course and the planet-girdling atmospheric bands of a Dweller-inhabited gas-giant expecting them to move along with everything else in a quite different direction, the possibility of sailing arose. And by sailing with sails dipped into the inside edges of giant storm systems, the sport could be made satisfactorily dangerous.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We must hope that this was not a ruse to get us away from the house, the colonel told Fassin. - And we must hope that Valseir will indeed contact you. If he is alive. We were given no hint that such might be the case. She looked at him. - Were we?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- None.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Almost the entire fleet of spectator craft had passed the starting grid. The GasClippers shook as one, then - bewilderingly quickly, when one knew they had no proper engines - they swung away towards the massive wall of dark, tearing cloud that was the inner limit of the great storm, peeling and jostling, weaving and carving through the gas as they fought for position, using the light breezes and simple gaseous inertia of the medium to allow them to steer while they rode their lines of force towards the storm wall.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- They never did find a body, though. This is right? Hatherence asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That’s right, Fassin told her. - Lost in a squall that could tear apart a StormJammer he wouldn’t have had much of a chance, but he might have lived.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yet there is no . . . water or the like? They cannot drown, and it is not too cold or hot. How do they die, just in a strong wind?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ripped apart, spun until they lose consciousness and then just whirled round too fast to hold together. Or left in a coma that means they do drop into the Depths. And they do need to breathe. If the pressure is too low, they can’t.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The GasClippers swung at the storm’s inner surface, half disappearing as their extending blade-sails cut into the stream of gas. They accelerated hard. Even with their head start and their bellowing engines labouring, even taking a shorter, inner-curve route, the spectator craft began to lose ground to the small fleet of speeding GasClippers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It is possible that Valseir somehow arranged the accident? the Colonel asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Possible. He might have arranged to have some friend, some accomplice nearby, to rescue him. It would make surviving likely rather than not.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do Dwellers often fake their own deaths?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Almost never.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So I thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The group of GasClippers was level with the centre of the greater fleet of spectator ships and the shouting and hollering in the spectator craft rose still further in pitch and volume as the whole mass of GasClippers and their accompanying squadrons of Blimpers and ancillary vessels seemed to move briefly as one, the dark storm wall a vertical sea, troubled and tattered, tearing past in front of them. A vast slanting band of shade rose up to meet them all as they moved into the shadow of the storm, the hazy point of Ulubis eclipsed by a roaring circlet of dementedly gyrating gas a hundred klicks high and ten thousand kilometres across.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fassin. Made any bets yet?’ Y’sul said, settling into his dent-seat alongside. A pet-child in a waiter’s uniform floated with a tray at his side, held back until the older Dweller settled into his seat, then left the tray with its drug paraphernalia clipped to the seat and retreated.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No. I’d be relying on your kudos, wouldn’t I?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh! I suppose you would,’ Y’sul agreed, apparently only now thinking this through. ‘Obviously I must trust you subconsciously. Most odd.’ He flipped to one side and started rummaging through the various drug works he’d brought back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How was your friend?’ Hatherence asked him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, in very good spirits,’ Y’sul said, not looking at her. ‘Father died yesterday in action. Stands to inherit kudos points for bravery or something.’ He kept on rummaging. ‘Sworn I got some FeverBrain . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good to know he’s taking it so well,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah! Here we are,’ Y’sul said, holding up a large bright orange capsule to take a good look at it. ‘Oh yes, Fassin: bumped into some youngster who claimed to know you. Gave me this.’ Y’sul dug into a pocket in his forebritch and came out with a tiny image-leaf, passing it to Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The human held it in one of the gascraft’s fine-scale manipulators and looked at the photograph. It was of white clouds in a blue sky.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, colour’s all wrong, obviously,’ Y’sul commented. ‘Couldn’t help noticing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was aware of the colonel looking at the image too. She sat back, silent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Did this person who claimed to know me actually say anything?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eh?’ Y’sul said, still studying the finger-sized orange lozenge. ‘Oh, yes. Said to take good care of that thing, and that they’ll be in the stern viewing-gallery restaurant if you wanted to see them. Alone, they said. Bit rude, I thought. Very young, though. Almost expect that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, thanks,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Nothing,’ Y’sul said with a wave. He popped the giant pill.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- With your permission, colonel, Fassin sent to Hatherence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Granted. Take care.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Excuse me,’ Fassin said as he rose from his dent-seat. Y’sul didn’t hear; two of the leading GasClippers were having a private duel, swerving dangerously close, weaving in and out of each other’s course, trying to tangle field lines, steal wind and so eddy-wake the other into dropping behind or crashing out, and Y’sul was floating high up out of his seat, shouting and whooping with all the other spectators not yet in their own little narcotic world.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The Dweller - a youth by his simple clothing and certainly looking at least that young - intercepted Fassin on the broad central corridor of the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>, falling into pace with him as he made his way towards the rear of the ship. Fassin turned fractionally towards his sudden companion, kept on going.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seer Taak?’ the youth said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Would you come with me, please?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin followed the young Dweller not to the stern viewing restaurant but to a private box slung low beneath the Blimper. The captain of the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> was there, talking to an old Dweller who looked to be at least early Sage in years. The captain turned when Fassin and the youth entered, then - with a small bow to Fassin - left with the youth, leaving Fassin alone in the round, diamond-bubble space with the aged Dweller. A few screens showed silent views of the race. A float tray to one side carried a large narcincenser, grey-blue smoke uncoiling from it, filling the cabin with haze and scent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is it you, old one?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am still me, young Taak,’ the familiar voice said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller floated up to him. If it was Valseir, he was no more shrunken but rather more dark than the last time Fassin had seen him. He had lost all the life charms and decorations and was dressed now in severely formal, almost monastic yellow part-robes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You have the token I sent?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin handed over the little image-leaf. The Dweller looked at it, rim mantle rippling in a smile. ‘Yes, you still wear us away, don’t you?’ He handed it back. ‘Take good care of that. And so, how was Oazil? I take it he found you at the house and you’re not here by coincidence.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He was well. Eccentric, but well.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old Dweller’s smile grew, then faded. ‘And the house? My libraries?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They are sinking into the Depths. What’s left.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What’s left?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A bit was missing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah. The study.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What happened to it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The CloudTunnel started to get too heavy to maintain. I had the house decoupled. I cleared the study first. The tunnel section fell into the Depths.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And the contents?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old Dweller roted back a fraction, creating small roils of smoke in the haze. ‘You are still testing me, aren’t you, Fassin Taak? You are still not prepared to trust me that I am who you think I am.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who do I think you are?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Your - I thought - old friend, Valseir, once choal, now acting like a Sage-child and hoping for the confirmation of my peers if I ever get to come out of hiding. Do you think I will ever get to come out of hiding, Seer Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That depends.’ Beyond the old Dweller, the GasClipper race continued, well ahead of the labouring Blimper. Screens relaying signals from camera jets showed the action in close-up. The sounds of distant cheers came through the open diamond-pane windows of the private box. ‘Why did you go into hiding?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller switched to signal-whispering. - Because I thought to skim through what I’d traded you for the Expressionist paintings you had brought. I read a certain note at the end of a certain volume. Which reminds me that I must apologise. It was not my intention to seem to fob you off with three different translations of the same volume instead of all three parts of the one work. However, read that note I did, and came to the conclusion that what was being referred to was the sort of information that people die for, and most certainly will kill for. I decided to disappear. I became dead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sorry I doubted you, Valseir,’ Fassin said, moving forward and holding out two manipulators towards the old Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Suspicious to the last,’ sighed Valseir, ignoring the left manipulator and shaking the right with his own extended right hub-arm. ‘There; how humans greet. Are you satisfied <span class="italic">now</span>, Seer Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin smiled. ‘Entirely. Good to see you again.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>- You must feel emotional pain, then. I feel sorry for you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I am trying not to feel too sorry for myself. Which is helped by getting on with what needs to be done.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had told Valseir about the attacks on Third Fury and Sept Bantrabal. Valseir had related his life since they had last met, a time dominated by the Dweller List in a way that even Fassin’s hadn’t been until recently. Most of that period he had spent in hiding, after arranging what looked like his own death with the help of Xessife, the Dweller captain whom Fassin had seen briefly earlier. He was an old StormSailor, a Jammerhand and Clipperine with a collection of trophies and medals that outweighed him. Retired now, pursuing a more contemplative course, content to take charge of a Blimper now and again just to stay part of the whole StormSailing scene.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And what needs to be done, Seer Taak?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I think we need to find that third volume. Do you still have it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I do not. However, it is not the third volume itself that is of consequence in this matter.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Then what is?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A note, a brief appendix.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do you have <span class="italic">that</span>?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Do you know where it is?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Then we may all, to use a human term, be fucked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I do know the direction it went in.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That could help.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You agree that it may be that important? That we may all be ‘fucked’ without it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh, we may very well all be thoroughly fucked <span class="italic">with</span> it, but without it, while people think this thing exists, they will do terrible things to anybody who gets in their way or isn’t being what they regard as a hundred per cent helpful. My minder here, an oerileithe Ocula colonel, tells me there’s a fleet of Mercatoria warships over Nasqueron. The excuse is they’re here to help pick up me and her, but I think they might have another purpose.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Military intervention?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The instant they think there might be a firm lead towards the List.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, we must try not to furnish them with one. I must also try not to furnish my fellow Dwellers with an excuse for regarding me as the most terrible traitor for even thinking of passing on anything to do with the thing in question to alien powers, even if my own studies and those of many others indicate that the data being sought is hopelessly out of date or a fantasy, or both. However, I do need to tell somebody which direction to point in, or I may have to stay dead for ever.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fate seems to dictate that it’s me you tell. Where do I go?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ah. Now then. I must explain. When I realised what was being referred to in the note in the first volume, I naturally looked for volume three. Well, at least I did so after spending some days in a state of horror and rage, realising that through no fault of my own - save the usually harmless hobby of bibliophilia - I had potentially unleashed something capable of destroying much, starting with my own quite happy and content life. This episode over, I devoted myself to my search and discovered the volume eventually. I have never had such cause to curse my own lackadaisical approach to cataloguing. The relevant piece was in the form of a separate folder attached within the appendices. I myself took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in the city of Deilte, in the South Polar Region, contained within a safekeep box which I asked him to look after for me, and not to open. In the event of my death, he was to hand the safekeep box on to somebody he in turn would trust not to open the box. A family member or some other trusted person would appear in due course carrying an image-leaf with a particular image in it. The one you now carry. They were to be given the box.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So would your friend in Deilte have known of your death? I didn’t.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Perhaps, perhaps not. He is an antiquarian data-collector like myself, but a recluse. He may have heard through mutual acquaintances.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Right, Fassin sent. - So I must make for Deilte. What was your friend’s name?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Chimilinith.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The name was barely out of Valseir’s signal pit when Fassin registered a neutrino burst.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Any particular part of Deilte? he asked, starting to look round in more detail.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Chimilinith tended to move his house around. But I imagine the locals will know of him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Okay. So, did you take a look at this data? What did it look like?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The diamond-bubble private box was nearly empty: just the two of them, the float-tray and bowl - he’d scanned them automatically when he’d entered and they were just what they appeared to be, no more - and the screens, which also seemed perfectly standard. Who’d be using neutrino comms? From where? Why the sudden burst, just then?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It looked like algebra.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin scanned Valseir’s simple clothes. No hint of anything high-tech there. The most sophisticated thing in his robes was the weave itself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Algebra? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was nothing on the inside or the outside surface of the diamond bubble itself. He scanned the access tube. Clear.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It looked like alien algebra, Valseir told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up at the undersurface of the Blimper immediately above, then swept for anything in the clear gas space outside within the same radius. Still nothing. Something further outside, then.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Alien? he asked, distracted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There seemed to be nothing nearby. There was the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>, then nothing for a hundred metres or so until the next Blimper, then the other spectator and ancillary craft beyond - with the single accompanying Dreadnought <span class="italic">Puisiel</span> a few klicks further up in the atmosphere, easily keeping pace with the spectating fleet - then the GasClippers themselves, currently starting to round the StormWall buoy which marked this short race’s first turning point.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Alien symbology. Though not entirely. I thought I recognised some of the symbols. They looked like a form of Translatory IV, a pan-species type, so-called ‘universal’ notation dating from perhaps two billion years ago, invented by the Wopuld - long extinct invert spongiforms - though with elements of ancient Dweller icons. I would have made notes, but I thought better of committing any of it to a form I could carry around save what exists - necessarily sketchy - in my own mind. Hence I have not been able to work on it since. </span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was taking in what was being said - and recording it on the gascraft’s systems in case he wanted to review it later - but he was still frantically scanning the volume all around them for some form of bug or surveillance device. Another burst of what certainly seemed like neutrino comms registered on the little gascraft’s sensors; a sudden pattern in the general wash of near-massless particle chaos.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The first burst had come immediately Valseir had spoken the name of the Dweller he’d given the folder to. Could it really just have been coincidence? But how could anybody have overheard? They were communicating by whisper signal, coherent light beams flickering from one surface-sunk transceiver pit to another. There was no way to intercept what they were saying unless someone dropped a mirror or some sensor into the beams.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Could it be him? Had the gascraft itself been bugged? Had Hatherence put something on him? He scanned and system-checked, finding nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Blimper above them ascended quickly and steadily as the GasClippers roared up the sheer face of the storm. The <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> rose into direct sunlight.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So, just a field of equations? Fassin asked the old Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The drug-fume haze in the private box was suddenly lit up, resolving into tiny individual particles of vapour, a tiny fraction of them glinting and glittering.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Possibly just the one long one.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Horrified, Fassin sucked a little of the surrounding vapour into the arrowhead’s high-res analysis unit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- One piece of algebra? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The results coming from the gascraft’s high-tech nose looked bizarre, surface receptors seeming to change their mind about what they were smelling. Fassin toggled the analysis down another level of detail to electron microscopy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Possibly, Valseir replied.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Outside, towards the StormWall, a few tens of metres away, something showed, briefly caught in the slanting sunlight and taking just an instant too long to adapt to the new lighting conditions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The results from the arrowhead’s internal electron microscope were for a moment baffling. Then Fassin realised what his analysis unit was looking at. Nanotech. A thin soup of tiny machines, receptors, analysers, processors and signallers, small enough to be suspended in the atmosphere, light enough to float in the midst of the drug smoke like particles of the fumes themselves. That was how they’d been bugged. There was something in the gas between them, riding right in the middle of their signal beams and capable of picking up their meaning. Nothing as gross as a mirror or some photon microphone dangling from a wire, just this, just these, just stuff that was supposed to be banned.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Valseir, he sent urgently. - Who brought this drug bowl in here?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He turned up visual magnification, staring hard at the point in the open gas outside, where something had shown in the sunlight an instant before. There. He up-magged again, almost to the point of graininess.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What? Valseir said, sounding confused. - Well, it was here when I—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A rough sphere, forty metres away, barely ten centimetres across, almost perfectly camouflaged, like a disc of clear glass in front of the real view. Hint of a comms pit, a tiny crater-like dish, pointing right at them. Fassin swung round to put himself between the tiny, distant machine and the old Dweller, then went right up to him, comms pit to comms pit like amorous Dwellers kiss-signalling.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir tried to rote back. - What the—?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We’ve been bugged, Valseir, Fassin sent. - Watched, listened to. The bowl smoke is part nanotech. We need to get out, now.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What? But—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another burst of neutrino comms. Now that he knew where to look, it was definitely coming from the camouflaged sphere outside.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Out, Valseir. <span class="italic">Now</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And another burst. This time from above. High above.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir pushed Fassin away. - The bowl smoke . . . ?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Get <span class="italic">out</span>! Fassin sent, pushing the old Dweller towards the access port in the top of the diamond bubble box.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Outside, the little sphere was rushing towards them. Fassin got underneath Valseir and forced him upwards.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin! All right! Valseir started to rise under his own power, entering the vertical access tube. The little sphere burst through the diamond bubble, shards spraying. It came to a stop just inside the jagged hole, still disguised, just a blur in the air.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Major Taak!’ it shouted. ‘This is General Linosu of the Shrievalty Ocula. This device is under the control of the Nasqueron Expeditionary Force. Don’t be alarmed. We’re coming down to—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The voice cut off as the little sphere was pierced by a hair-thin line of cerise light. The noise resounded, sharp and sudden, round the diamond bubble enclosure. Debris flew from the tiny machine, rattling against the far side of the private box. Fassin whirled to see Hatherence dropping down round the side of the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>, carapace silvered. The laser beam had come from her. The little spherical device dropped its disguise, revealing itself as a mirror-finish machine with stubby wings. It had a tiny hole in one flank, a much larger one on the far side, producing smoke. It rolled over in the air, made a crackling noise, then dropped to the transparent floor. Above him, Fassin was aware of Valseir hesitating in the access tube. Slipstream wind whistled in through the hole in the diamond bubble.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The colonel swung quickly in towards them. - You all right, major? she signalled, stopping immediately outside, buffeted by the slipstream. She tipped to look at the device lying rolling on the clear curved floor of the box.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Shit, she sent. - That looks like one of ours.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was a white flash, as though from everywhere at once, blinding Fassin for an instant. As the light faded Hatherence was already falling away, tumbling like a dropped stone through the gas. Something moved, faster than the GasClippers, across the StormWall face, carving in towards the Blimper.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When the colonel had fallen twenty metres below the private box, a line of searing yellow-white light flicked into existence between the incoming machine and Hatherence’s esuit, which erupted in fire and blew apart. The fast-moving device looked like a small gascraft or missile, sharp and finned. Its exhaust flared bright as it powered round.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked down to see Hatherence. She was a dark, ragged manta shape falling, whirling downwards amongst the smoking debris of the destroyed esuit. She seemed to twist in the air, flicking round, something glinting in a stubby tentacle; a violet beam lanced towards the finned craft, missing by a metre. Another white line from the machine speared the colonel, obliterating her in a sun-bright burst of light.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir had cleared the access tube. Fassin blasted up it like a shell up a gun barrel, letting the pulse of down draught tear the diamond bubble box out in a convulsive explosion of wreckage that whipped away from the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> and followed the remains of the colonel and her esuit towards the storm’s concave base and the Depths beyond.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir was waiting in the broad corridor above. ‘Fassin! <span class="italic">What</span> is going on?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How do we get off this thing?’ he asked, taking the old Dweller by the hub-arm and leading him towards the next vertical access.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Do we really need to?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Something’s attacking us, Valseir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Are you sure?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes. So how do we get off?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What’s wrong with roting?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Bit vulnerable. I was thinking of a craft.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, I’m sure we can arrange a taxi. Or one of the Blimper’s own skiffs. I’ll ask Captain Xessife.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No,’ Fassin said. ‘Not Captain Xessife.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why not?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Somebody had to put that drug bowl there.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They got to the vertical. ‘But . . .’ Valseir hesitated. ‘Wait, what’s that noise?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin could hear a deep warbling sound coming from various directions. ‘That could be an alarm.’ He indicated the tube above. ‘After you. Let’s move.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were halfway up the vertical to the central corridor when the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> lurched. ‘Oh-oh,’ Valseir said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Keep going.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When they got to the main concourse, the alarm noise was louder. Dwellers were shouting at each other, picking up dropped trays, food and drugs and staring at some of the wall-screens. Fassin looked too. ‘Oh fuck,’ he said quietly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screens showed confused pictures of the surroundings, not all the cameras and screens now focusing on the still continuing GasClipper race. One camera seemed to be following a slim, finned craft, the one which had attacked Hatherence, as it circled the Blimper.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Other screens showed ships, dozens of dark ships, dropping from the sky.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were gas-capable Mercatoria spacecraft, some as little as fifty metres long, others three or four times that size; soot-black ellipsoids with thick wings and sleek but rudimentary tailplanes and engine pods. They were diving towards the Blimper fleet, two or three peeling off every vertical klick or so to circle, guarding. Much higher above - another snatched camera angle, drifting out of focus then snapping clear - more slick shapes gyrated above the high haze layer, like scavengers over carrion.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another screen’s view spun, then settled, jerking, on the spectating fleet’s accompanying Dreadnought, the <span class="italic">Puisiel</span>, whose turrets were swinging, gun barrels elevating. A yellow-white beam flicked on and off, boring straight through the war craft, making it shudder and sending shock waves running along its outer fabric. The beam hit the StormWall beyond at almost the same time, raising a dark puff of vapour like a bruise, quickly whipped away. The GasClippers seemed to have disappeared.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What in all the gods’ farts is going on?’ Valseir asked. They had come to a stop, transfixed by the screens like most of the rest of the people in the concourse.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Puisiel</span>’s turrets and guns continued to swing round for a moment, then came to rest, seemingly pointing in random directions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, don’t,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dreadnought’s guns flashed, gouting fire and smoke. Smaller shapes dropped away from it at the same time, half obscured by the wreathing broadside smoke clouds, and then pulsed fire and smoke from their rears and started curving up and out towards the dropping spacecraft. Screens blinked. The dark, descending spacecraft glittered with light. Midway between the <span class="italic">Puisiel</span> and the scatter of black ships, piercing white lines ended in sudden detonations, filling the gas above and around the spectating fleet with black bursts of smoke.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A screen swung to show one turning spacecraft dropping, trailing smoke. Dwellers started yelling. Trays, food, drugs and pet-children were sent flying, carapace skins blazed naked signals of excitement and fury and whiffs of war-lust filled the air as though a series of tiny scent-grenades had gone off along the concourse. A black dot trailing a haze of exhaust sailed in towards the crippled spacecraft but was picked off from above in a blast of light. Then something still smaller and faster darted across the screen and hit the ship, detonating inside and tearing it entirely in half; the two torn sections flew down towards the Depths, dangled on elongating strings of smoke. The other missiles were picked off even more easily, swatted like slow insects.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin started pulling Valseir away. Dwellers all around them howled and barked at the screens and started taking bets. Distant concussive thumps and longer roars sounded throughout the concourse, bringing the long-delayed battle sounds to accompany the near-instant visuals.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dark glitterings, everywhere. The Dreadnought lit up all along its length, speckled with fire. The beams lanced it, plunging on into the StormWall, freckling bruises across the stir of dark gas. About a third of a last broadside, most of it aimed at where the fallen spaceship had been, punched out from the <span class="italic">Puisiel</span> a fraction of a second before the first beams hit. The great vessel shook like a leaf in a storm, then started to drop even as further rays riddled it. A final beam, less bright, much broader, punched through the whole central section, folding the craft about its middle and sending it flowing and spiralling downwards. A few tiny double discs drifted away from the stricken war craft and roted away or just fell, some trailing smoke. Some were hit by further beams of light, vanishing in miniature explosions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Valseir, move,’ Fassin whispered in the sudden silence. ‘We have to get away. Just get to the outside.’ They were almost level with a 45° up-access tube. Fassin nudged Valseir towards it. ‘This way.’ He didn’t even know if they really should get away. Maybe they were still somehow safer here in the Blimper. At least closer to the outside they might have more choice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir allowed himself to be pushed towards the slope of the access tube. The lowest part of the fleet of dark ships was now almost level with the top of the spectating fleet. Howls started to fill the concourse. Fassin and Valseir were being held back from the tube entrance by a stream of Dwellers coming in the other direction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin continued to push the old Dweller, though they both kept looking back at the screens. One of the dark ships circled gradually closer to the StormWall. Near its closest approach, a GasClipper came hurtling out of the dark curtain of whirling gas, blade sails extended like a frozen gleaming explosion. It rammed the dark warship amidships, hammering into it and pushing the two craft across the sky in a single tangled flailing mass. Still locked in their terrible embrace, the two craft started to fall away with everything else, heading for the foot of the storm’s great dark well and the hot crush of gas beneath.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">More screams and barks of joy echoed round the concourse.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another camera, another screen: a section of the StormWall was bulging, dark gas streaming around some huge rounded cone forcing its way through the storm as though it wasn’t there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A huge Dreadnought flowed out of the storm, trailing streamers of gas like vast banners. Shrieks of encouragement and great, air-quaking cheers resounded down the wide tunnel of the concourse, making it resonate like a vast organ pipe. The new Dreadnought silvered in an instant, white beams scattering off it as it flew into the clear gas heart of the storm’s colossal eye.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Fuck</span> me,’ Fassin heard himself say. ‘They were waiting for them.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The silver Dreadnought powered straight towards the fleet of dark ships, which, after starting to close in on the spectating fleet, were now swinging and swivelling to reconfigure and face the new threat.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dreadnought raced forward, fire bright around its propellerless tail, guns firing and flashing. Its silvery skin, reflecting sky, storm and dark depths, sparkled with jagged scintillations, bouncing beams off in random directions like bright thrown spines. Two more of the dark ships detonated and fell, sending the Dweller screams in the concourse - and the bets - towards even wilder heights.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dreadnought tore onwards, shaking under the weight of fire falling upon it. A missile from the fleet of Mercatoria ships slashed across the view, was missed by a fan of interceptor fire from the Dreadnought and slammed into it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was just the hint of the start of an explosion, bursting the Dreadnought apart as though tearing open the wrapping round a piece of star, then the screen went utterly white before hazing out completely, blank. Lights in the concourse flickered and went out, came back, then faded again. The warbling sound, there but effectively unheard all this time, cut off, its absence in the sudden silence like a hearing loss. The <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> quivered like a struck animal.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Other screens wavered, went black, filled with static. Some screens, now providing the only light in the concourse, remained working. Gradually more light filled the long tube, as low emergency lighting strobed on, caught and held.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A low muttering sound of Dweller trepidation and resentment started to build. One camera swung to show the huge rolling mushroom cloud filling the space where the Dreadnought had been. A few tiny pieces of wreckage fell, far away, thin claws from a tumorously bloated fist. The dark ships started to close in again on the spectator fleet, currently composed of vessels commanded by two sorts of captains: those who thought it best to clump together and those who regarded scattering and even taking their chances with the storm winds as the safer bet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The stampede of Dwellers from the access tube which Fassin was trying to push Valseir towards was slowly forcing the two of them back into the centre of the concourse. More people were flooding into the wide space from every other access point.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Somebody was screaming, ‘Look, look!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">One distant screen image was suddenly repeated across several more. At first it looked like a replay of the entrance of the first Dreadnought, the great nose bulging out through the curtain of streaming cloud, dragging gas like long flags of war. Then the view pulled back and the screen showed the StormWall bulging in another place, then another and another and another, until a whole vertical forest of the great ships was visible, hurtling out of the storm and towards the great column of black circling spacecraft hanging like a giant pendulum over the spectating fleet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> shook, rippled and screamed like something alive as the shock wave of the earlier nuclear explosion seemed to pick it up and rattle it. Dwellers swung this way and that across the concourse, banging into each other, walls, floor and ceiling, filling the gas with oaths and debris. Another pair of screens cut out but enough remained to show the closing fleet of mercury-coloured Dreadnoughts livid with fire outgoing and incoming. Lasers sheened off, fans of interceptor projectiles and beams combed the gas and sundered darting, twisting missiles. Two more of the dark ships, then a third, exploded or crumpled and started to fall or spiral down, but two more of the giant Dreadnoughts disappeared in massive, screen-hazing detonations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A couple more Dreadnoughts were suddenly caught in a fiercely bright beam from immediately above, from out of the clear yellow sky. The beam fell between them, making each massive ship wobble as if stumbling in the gas. Then it split into two parallel shafts, each violet rod narrowing in an instant and chopping through its targeted Dreadnought like an axe through a neck.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The concourse - half dark, filled with wild scents and the frenzied bellowing of Dwellers unsure whether to wail laments or shout huzzahs, lit by the spastic, spasming light of the battle views swinging wildly across the screens - achieved a sort of chaotic transcendence as very loud but defiantly soothing-sounding music started to play, product of some confused automatic guest-management system waking to insanity and trying to spread tranquillity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What,’ Fassin heard a nearby Dweller say, quite quietly but distinctly through the pandemonium, ‘the fuck is <span class="italic">that</span>?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">(Another dark Mercatorial ship, another silver Dreadnought, ripped to shreds and blossoming in nuclear fire respectively. Another pair of Dreadnoughts shaking in the first beam-fall of the violet ray flicking from on high.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And on the screen opposite, looking downwards into the wide bowl of the storm’s dead heart, a huge darkly red-glowing globe was rising from the sump gases of the storm floor, dragging a great flute of gas after it like some absurdly steady fireball. It was kilometres across and striated, banded like a miniature gas-giant, so that for one crazed instant Fassin thought he was watching the palace of the Hierchon Ormilla floating smoothly upwards into the fray.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A crumpled scrap falling towards this apparition - a ruined and smoking Mercatoria spacecraft - appeared to lend a scale to the huge sphere, seeming to be about to fall just behind it, making the quickly rising globe three or four klicks across.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The wrecked ship fell in front, instead, and upped that ready estimate by a factor of two.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A couple of filament-thin yellow-white beams suddenly joined with the massive globe and seemed to sink into it without effect. The violet beam from high above swung onto it, spreading briefly as though to measure the full seven or eight kilometres of its diameter before starting to narrow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A pattern of black dots appeared on the surface of the giant globe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> shook again and again as further blast waves crashed into it. Fassin stared at the great rising sphere even as Dwellers on either side thudded into him and he lost his hold on Valseir.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There were maybe fifty or so of the black spots, spread as though randomly across the upper hemisphere of the huge globe. One appeared to be in the centre of the rapidly narrowing, focusing violet beam. Just as that ray grew too bright to see the ebony dot at its centre, it seemed to pulse and spread. Then it disappeared, just as each spot suddenly became the plinth for an intensely bright, thin column of pure white light. The beams lasted for an eye-blink, disappearing almost as soon as they’d been produced, only their image lasting, burned into any naked eyes and insufficiently buffered cameras trained on them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Silence, even as another manic convulsion shook the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>, making the whole concourse ripple and creak. More screens went out. The loud soothing music cut off. Two remaining screens nearby showed the dark ships, whole squadrons of them, entire flocks of them, reduced for most of their length to sparkling, wind-blown ash, only the long needle noses and tailed, finned rears remaining intact to fall like meteors, unreeling scrawny trails of smoke into the storm’s tenebrous depths.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The nearest screen showed the camera swinging across the sky, searching for an intact Mercatoria ship, only to find further drifts of smoke, new clouds of ash, already drifting on the wind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The other screen’s view pivoted to the sky, where something glowing yellow was fading and disappearing as it cooled, at first still keeping station with the scene directly beneath, then starting to drift away to the east.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The huge sphere was still rising, though slowing now, coming gradually level with the remains of the spectating fleet. The remaining two dozen or so mirror-finish Dreadnoughts were decelerating, heaving-to on one side of the clumped and scattered ships.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A bellowing roar of utter - and unexpected - victory built quickly in every Dweller throat along the length of the concourse, swelling to a clanging, thunderous cacophony of mind-splitting, thought-warping sound.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then a series of crashing, titanic shock waves pummelled the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> like a gale whipping a flag. A barrage of noise like a troop of titans clapping entirely drowned out the hollering Dwellers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">All the screens went dark. The Blimper <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> lurched for one last time, then started to fall out of the sky. Those Dwellers not already heading swiftly for the exits immediately began to do so, the ones near Fassin sweeping him along with them, up the access tube he’d been trying to head for originally, out via a wide funnel port into a viewing gallery, through its massively shattered diamond roof and out into the bruised and battered skies of Nasqueron.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘You mean some of your ridiculous fucking fairy stories about secret ships and hyper-weapons are actually <span class="italic">true</span>?’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well,’ Y’sul said, looking round. ‘So it would appear.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were somewhere inside the <span class="italic">Isaut</span>, the enormous spherical ship which had destroyed almost the entire Mercatorial fleet - space-based command-and-control plus heavy-weaponry bombardment back-up included - in the space of about half a second. The <span class="italic">Isaut</span> was something called a Planetary Protector (Deniable), not that Fassin or, apparently, anybody else rescued from the destroyed and damaged ships of the spectating fleet had ever heard of such a thing. That, as Y’sul had pointed out, was a pretty unarguably convincing brand of deniability.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There had, of course, been rumours and myths concerning secret Dweller martial capability and the general lack of wisdom of getting into a fight with such an ancient and widespread species for as long as people could remember, but - as most of these myths and rumours seemed to be spread by the Dwellers themselves - as a rule nobody ever really took them seriously. The Dwellers spent so much time huffing and puffing and telling people how completely wonderful and brilliant they were - and yet seemed so self-obsessed, so inward-looking and so careless of their distant fellows, so unconnected not just with the rest of the civilised galaxy but with their own vastly scattered diaspora - they were inevitably dismissed as vainglorious fantasists and their vaunted ships and weapons, at best, a sort of folk memory of earlier magnificence, long lost, entirely eclipsed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even now, having just seen the results of the <span class="italic">Isaut</span>’s intervention with his own eyes - or at least through the little gascraft’s sensors - Fassin could not entirely believe what he’d witnessed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, this is a strange place to be,’ Valseir said, looking about the spherical space he, Y’sul and Fassin had been shown to.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They had rendezvoused quite quickly in the general gas-borne confusion of survivors from the <span class="italic">Dzunda</span>. Fassin’s arrrowhead-shaped craft, though smaller than all the surrounding Dwellers, was a sufficiently different shape for Valseir and Y’sul to spot him quite without difficulty and head in his direction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why is everybody else giving me such a wide berth?’ Fassin had asked when they’d each drifted up to him in the after-battle calmness. It was true; all the other Dweller survivors were keeping a good fifty metres or so away from him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Worried you’re going to be a target,’ Y’sul had said, checking his various pockets and pouches to see what he might have lost in the excitement. Around them, various long smoky columns were drifting in the breeze like anaemic stalks rooted in the dark storm base far below, and great dumb-bell-shaped clouds - all that was left of the nuclear explosions - were twisting and slowly tearing apart, their round, barely rolling heads still climbing into higher and higher levels of atmosphere, being caught in differential wind streams and casting vast hazy shadows across the again-quiet skies of the storm’s eye. Hovering to one side, the vast banded sphere which had risen from the Depths floated like a miniature planet caught in the eye of the great storm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">To one side, in the StormWall, the GasClipper fleet seemed to be trying to regroup. Tumbling out of the sinking <span class="italic">Dzunda</span> with the rest of the survivors, only a lifelong exposure to Dweller insouciance - both congenital and feigned - had prevented Fassin gasping in disbelief at the sound of various people around him quite seriously discussing whether the GasClipper race would just continue, be restarted or declared void, and passing opinions regarding the status of already existing bets in the light of this suite of likely choices.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The less damaged spectating and other craft were picking up the various free-floating Dwellers. Ambulance skiffs from the surviving craft in the silver Dreadnought fleet and hospital vessels from the nearest port facilities were rescuing the more seriously injured and burned individuals.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had indeed been targeted, but not by weaponry. A trio of skiffs had emerged from the giant sphere and made straight for the little group formed by Fassin and his two Dweller friends. They’d been taken aboard and the skiffs returned immediately to the enormous globe, ignoring the outraged yells of the Dwellers who until moments before had been studiously avoiding Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The lead skiff, crewed by a jolly pair of remarkably old-looking Dwellers - they didn’t volunteer their names, ranks or ages, but they each looked at least as old as Jundriance - had deposited them somewhere deep inside the giant spherical craft, way down a dark tunnel into a broad sphere of reception space, complete with washing facilities and what Y’sul had taken one look at and sniffily dismissed as a snack-ateria. Before they’d left again in their skiff, it had been one of these unnamed Dwellers who, in response to a question of Fassin’s, had told them the name and category of the great craft they’d been brought inside. Fassin had warned him that his gascraft had been in contact with Mercatoria nanotech and he might be contaminated, which did not surprise or alarm anybody aboard as much as he’d been expecting. The skiff’s crew scanned the little gascraft and told him, well, he wasn’t contaminated any more.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Where is your little friend the Very Reverend Colonel?’ Y’sul asked Fassin, making a show of looking around the reception space. ‘She jumped out of her seat and raced off just before all the fun started.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘She’s dead,’ Fassin told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Dead?’ Y’sul rolled back. ‘But she seemed so well armed!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘She shot what turned out to be a Mercatorial . . . device,’ Fassin said. ‘One of the first of their craft on the scene seemed to assume this meant she was a hostile and wasted her.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh,’ Y’sul said, sounding downcast. ‘That was the Mercatoria, was it? Not these Disconnected people. You sure?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m fairly sure,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Damn,’ Y’sul said, sounding annoyed. ‘Might sort of look like I’ve lost a bet, in that case. Wonder how I can get out of it?’ He floated off, looking deep in thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin turned to Valseir. ‘You sure you’re all right?’ he asked. The old Dweller had looked a little shaken when they’d rendezvoused in the gas above the sinking Blimper, though apart from a few carapace abrasions picked up in the welter of people rushing to escape the sinking ship, he was uninjured.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am fine, Fassin,’ he told the human. ‘And you? You have lost your colonel friend, I heard.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had a sudden reprise of his last image of Hatherence, that dark manta shape twisting in the air - to a Dweller she would have looked like one of their young - firing a hand weapon at the craft that had ripped her out of her esuit, then dying in the returning splash of fire. ‘I’m getting used to anybody who gets close to me dying violently,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm. I consider myself warned,’ Valseir said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘She was my superior, Valseir,’ Fassin told him. ‘She was my bodyguard but she was also my guard in another sense. I’d be surprised if she hadn’t been given orders to kill me if the relevant circumstances arose.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Do you think she would have carried out those orders?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin hesitated, suddenly feeling bad about what he’d just said, even though he still thought it was the truth. It was as though he’d insulted Hatherence’s memory. He looked away and said, ‘Well, we’ll never know now, will we?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A door in the centre of the ceiling swung back. They all looked up. Two Dwellers entered. Fassin recognised one of them as Setstyin, the self-confessed influence pedlar he’d talked to by phone the evening he’d slipped away from Y’sul’s house in Hauskip city. The other Dweller looked very old indeed, dark and small - barely five metres in diameter - and dressed in high-coverage clothes that probably concealed only a few remaining natural limbs and perhaps some prosthetics.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seer Fassin Taak,’ Setstyin said, roll-nodding towards him. Then he greeted Y’sul and lastly Valseir - as the most senior of the three Valseir came last and got an even more respectful bow. ‘Y’sul, Valseir: allow me to introduce the Sage-cuspian-chospe Drunisine, Executive Commander of this craft, the Planetary Protector (Deniable) <span class="italic">Isaut</span>.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A pleasure,’ said the dark Dweller in a crisp, dry-sounding voice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And for us an <span class="italic">honour</span>,’ Y’sul said, brushing Fassin out of the way to present himself to the fore and execute an extravagantly complete bow. ‘If I may say so.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Our pleasure, pre-child,’ Valseir half-agreed, also roll-bowing, less completely but with more dignity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good to see you, Setstyin,’ Fassin said. ‘And pleased to meet you, sir,’ he told the older Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Drunisine was by far the oldest and most senior Dweller Fassin had ever encountered. As a Dweller - surviving the perils of childhood first, obviously - rose through Adolescence, Youth and Adulthood to attain the life stages called Prime and then Cuspian and then Sage, what they were eventually aiming for - destined for, if they lived that long - was to reach Childhood, the state of utter done-everythingness that was the absolute zenith of all Dweller existence. The stage immediately before this culmination was the one which Drunisine had reached: <span class="italic">chospe</span> - pre-child. There was every chance that Drunisine was over two billion years old.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My name is Setstyin,’ the other Dweller said, coming to rest near the centre of the spherical room with the Sage and looking round at the others. ‘I am a friend of Seer Taak’s here. You are all sufficiently recovered and/or rested, I hope. Because we need to talk.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They agreed they were capable of talk. Setstyin waved and hammock seats descended from a ring round the ceiling door, which then closed. They settled in.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seer Taak,’ the ancient Dweller said. ‘We will need to ensure that all record of the battle just finished is wiped from the memories of that little craft you inhabit.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I understand,’ Fassin said. He thought about that ‘(Deniable)’. He called up everything he’d recorded of the battle in the storm’s eye and full-deleted it. He called up a lot of other stored memories and got rid of those too. ‘It’s done,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We will need to check,’ Setstyin told him, sounding apologetic.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Feel free,’ Fassin said. ‘I take it we’re not supposed to say anything about what happened out there. Or about this thing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Say what you like, young sir,’ Drunisine told him. ‘Our concern is with hard evidence.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All surviving non-Dweller surveillance systems around Nasqueron have been removed,’ Setstyin said, talking to Fassin. ‘All the transgressing ships which had line-of-sight to the proceedings have already been destroyed. The remains of the Mercatorial fleet are being pursued and dispatched.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They are being hunted down like <span class="italic">dogs</span>, Seer Taak,’ Drunisine said, looking straight at him and using the Anglish word. ‘Harried, systems jammed, comms disrupted, fates sealed, all so that no direct evidence of this craft or its capabilities, even that garnered second-hand, can escape. I might add that your own summary annihilation was contemplated.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am grateful to have been made an exception,’ Fassin said. ‘Are none of the ships which were above Nasqueron to be allowed to escape?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘None,’ the ancient Dweller said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Those who start wars have to accept the consequences,’ Y’sul said, rumbling sententiously.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And after that?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Specify, please.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Is this the start of a war with the Mercatoria, at least the part within Ulubis?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t imagine so,’ Drunisine said, sounding as though this was the first time the thought had occurred. ‘Not unless they choose to invade us again. Do you think they will, Fassin Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had the awful feeling that, given the Dwellers’ irredeemably dismissive approach to intelligence, what he said next might well constitute the single most germane piece of information on the matter that the Dwellers would have to work with and base their decisions on.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, I don’t. I think they’ll be sufficiently horrified at the extent of their losses today to think twice about risking any further craft, certainly as long as they have the prospect of invasion to look forward to. If the invasion fails, or the system is finally recaptured, then there might be some attempt to find out what happened and no doubt some people will argue that there should be some form of reprisal. Though, in the shorter term, from what little I’ve heard of the Epiphany 5 Disconnect, there’s a chance they might want to, ah, transgress, too.’ He looked at Drunisine and Setstyin, who remained silent. ‘Though I’m sure you’ll be ready for them.’ More silence. ‘In fact, if the Ulubis Mercatoria work out what’s happened here and realise you don’t regard this as the start of a war, they might even want to suggest that you and they unite to resist the Epiphany 5 Disconnect forces.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why would we wish to do that?’ Drunisine asked flatly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It felt like it had been a long and tiring day. Fassin didn’t really have the energy to start trying to explain. From a creature as old and experienced as Drunisine, the question was probably rhetorical anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Never mind,’ Fassin said. ‘Act as though nothing’s happened. Signal ’glantine and make some helpful suggestions regarding the re-establishment of a new Seer Shared Facility.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s more or less what we were going to do anyway,’ Setstyin said, sounding amused.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin signalled polite mirth in return. He was still struggling to work out what this enormous, fleets-destroyed-in-an-eyeblink craft really <span class="italic">meant</span>. Who was responsible for this colossal machine? What sort of previously unknown societal structures and prodigious manufacturing capacity within Dweller civilisation could conjure up something this awesome? Was it a one-off? Was it unique to Nasqueron? Dear grief, was it part of a <span class="italic">fleet</span>? Did this mean that <span class="italic">all</span> the Dweller claims about secret ships and hyper-weapons were true? Could the Nasqueron Dwellers just swat the E-5 Discon out of the sky if they so desired, saving Ulubis from invasion? Could they feasibly take on the Mercatoria if they could be bothered? Did any of this mean that the Dweller List was now more likely to be genuine rather than some monstrous waste of time or just a joke? How he’d have liked to have had some time alone with Setstyin before this meeting, to find out what had happened since they’d talked last. He’d have to ask some of these questions anyway, given half a chance.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We come, then,’ Drunisine said, ‘to the question of why the Ulubis Mercatoria Disconnect thought it might be a wise or profitable idea to enter Nasqueron in such a manner and in such numbers in the first place. Any ideas? Anybody?’ The ancient Dweller looked round at all of them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think it might have something to do with me,’ Fassin admitted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You, Seer Taak?’ Drunisine asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ve been here attempting to track down some information. ’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And you needed the help of a small war fleet to extract it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No. However, they might have thought I was in danger.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘From whom?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t know.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, we are talking about information that the Mercatoria might consider momentous enough to start a war for? When they are already facing an invasion in the next few months or years? This must be information of some importance. Perhaps we can help. What is it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thank you. However, I think I may finally be close to finding it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah,’ Valseir said. ‘About that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’ Fassin asked him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All that stuff about the folder and the safekeep box and taking it personally to Chimilinith of Deilte?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not entirely true.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not entirely?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not entirely.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So how much of it <span class="italic">was</span> true?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir rocked back a fraction, seemingly thinking. Patterns of surprise crossed his signal skin. ‘Actually, most of it,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And the part that wasn’t?’ Fassin asked patiently.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There was no folder in the safekeep box.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So Chimilinith hasn’t got the information.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Correct.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I see.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am still waiting for enlightenment regarding the exact nature of this exemplary, if shy, information,’ Drunisine said frostily, looking at Valseir.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh shit</span>, Fassin thought, <span class="italic">if Valseir tells them what it is, and it really exists, they might just kill us all</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Possibly the same thought had occurred to Valseir. ‘It allegedly involves a method for travelling faster than light,’ he told the ancient commander.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin’s carapace flashed hilarity, quickly damped. Drunisine looked about as thoroughly unimpressed as it was possible for an elderly Dweller to look. ‘What?’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘An ancient addition to a still more ancient book - which Seer Taak here traded over two hundred years ago during a “delve”, as the Quick call these things - makes mention of a method of achieving FTL travel without recourse to Adjutage and Cannula,’ Valseir said, using what Fassin recognised as the Dweller terms for portals and wormholes. Fassin thought - and sincerely hoped - that Valseir had put just the right amount of apology and wry amusement into his voice. ‘Seer Taak has been sent here to try to find the details of this, ah, unlikely technology.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed?’ Drunisine said, looking at Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Algebra,’ he blurted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Algebra?’ Drunisine asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The data looks like a piece of algebra, apparently,’ Fassin said. ‘It defines some sort of warping device. A way of bending space. Conventional to start with, but using this technique to exceed light speed.’ Fassin made a gesture of resignation. He let embarrassment patterns show on his arrowhead’s skin. ‘I was seconded without any real choice into a paramilitary part of the Mercatoria and ordered to undertake this mission. I am as sceptical as I imagine you are, sir, regarding the likelihood of it coming to a successful conclusion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Drunisine let the most formal amusement pattern show on his skin. ‘Oh, I doubt that you are, Seer Taak.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘What’s going on?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I was about to ask you the same question,’ Setstyin told Fassin. ‘Shall we trade?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All right, but I asked first.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What exactly do you want to know?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were still in the reception sphere inside the giant globe. Commander Drunisine had left. Two Adult medical orderlies were dealing with the few small injuries that Y’sul and Valseir had picked up during the battle. ‘What <span class="italic">is</span> this thing?’ Fassin asked, gesturing to indicate the whole ship. ‘Where did it come from? Who made it? Who controls it? How many are there in Nasqueron?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’d have thought the title said it all,’ Setstyin said. ‘It’s a machine to protect the planet. From willed aggression of a certain technical type and sophistication. It’s not a spacecraft, if that’s what you mean. It’s limited to in-atmosphere. It came from the Depths, where stuff like this is usually stored. We made it. I mean Dwellers did, probably a few billion years ago. I’d have to check. It’s controlled by people in the control centre, who’ll be Dwellers with military experience who’ve sim-trained for this sort of device specifically. As to numbers . . . I wouldn’t know. Probably not the sort of information one’s meant to share, really. No offence, Fass, but in the end you’re not actually one of us. We have to assume your loyalties lie elsewhere.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Built billions of years ago? Can you still—?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, that would count as a follow-up question,’ Setstyin said, chiding. ‘I think it’s my turn first.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin sighed. ‘All right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Are you really looking for this warp-drive FTL technology data? You do realise it doesn’t exist, don’t you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s data that the Mercatoria believe might give them a better chance of winning the fight against the E-5 Discon. They are desperate. They’ll try anything. And I have my orders, no matter what I might think about the whole thing. Of course I know independent FTL drives don’t exist.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Will you still obey these orders, given the chance?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought about Aun Liss, about the people he’d known in Hab 4409, about all the other people he’d ever known throughout Ulubis system over the years. ‘Yes,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why do you obey these orders?’ Setstyin sounded genuinely puzzled. ‘Your family and Seer Sept colleagues are almost all dead, your immediate military superior was killed in the recent battle and there is nobody nearby now to take her place.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s complicated,’ Fassin told Setstyin. ‘Perhaps it’s duty or a guilty conscience or just the desire to be doing something. <span class="italic">Can</span> you still make more of these planetary protection machines?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No idea,’ Setstyin admitted. ‘Don’t see why not, though. I’d suggest asking somebody who might know, but even if the true answer was no we’d be bound to say yes, wouldn’t we?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Was it my call to you that set all this in motion?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’re getting a lot of free questions, aren’t you? However, yes, it did. Though I suspect that watching dozens of recently modified gas-capable warcraft suddenly parking themselves in orbit around us might have started a few alarm bells ringing amongst us even without your timely warning. Still, we’re grateful. I don’t think I’m entirely out of formation in saying that there is a feeling we probably owe you a favour.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And if the Mercatoria ever finds out,’ Fassin said, ‘I’ll be executed as a traitor.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, we won’t tell if you don’t,’ Setstyin said, perfectly seriously.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Deal,’ Fassin said, unconvinced.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The great spherical craft <span class="italic">Isaut</span> floated deep within a vast cloud of streaming gas, moving swiftly, seeming not to. It had started to submerge into the storm’s curdled floor of slowly swirling gas almost as soon as Fassin and the others had been brought aboard. Sinking, sidling, rising slightly again, it had entered into the Zone 2 weather band, quickly assumed its speed, and was now, in the late evening that was becoming night, half a thousand kilometres away from the storm where the battle had taken place, and adding another three hundred kilometres to that value with every passing hour.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin, Y’sul, Valseir and Setstyin floated over a narrow platform set at the great vessel’s equator, near the body of Colonel Hatherence. A weak light and weaker breeze lent an appropriate atmosphere of quiet gloom to the scene. The colonel’s torn, burned body had been discovered along with hundreds of others, floating at the level at which Dweller bodies usually came to rest. Hers had come to rest a little higher than the others, as would a child’s.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Left to themselves, Dweller bodies degassed and gained density, and abandoned to the atmosphere would eventually disappear completely into the Depths. The respectful convention, however, was either to keep a dead relative in a special ceremonial chamber at home and let them decay until their density would ensure a swift passage into the liquid hydrogen far beneath, or - if time was pressing - to weight the body and consign it to the Depths that way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hatherence had no family here. There was not even anybody of her own species in all Nasqueron, and so - as, at least, a fellow alien - Fassin had been declared responsible for her remains. He’d agreed a swift dispatch to the Depths was preferable to keeping her body and handing it back to the Shrievalty or any family she might still have in Ulubis system. He wasn’t even sure why he felt that way, but he did. There was no particular veneration of the remains of the dead in the way of the Truth, and, as far as he knew, no special meaning amongst oerileithe in having their dead returned from afar, but even if there had been, he’d have wanted something like this. For the Dwellers, it was probably just administrative convenience, even tidiness to dispose of her now, like this. For him, it was something more.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked down at the alien body - thin and dark, something between a manta and a giant starfish - lying in its coffin of meteorite iron. Iron had always been and, sentimentally, ceremonially, still was a semi-precious metal for Dwellers. That they were burying Hatherence like this was something of an honour, he supposed. In the fading light, her ragged remains, dark anyway, then burned by the beam which had killed her, looked like scraps of shadow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin felt tears in his real eyes, inside the shock-gel inside the little gascraft that was his own tiny life-coffin, and knew that some deep, near-animal part of him was mourning not so much the fallen Oculan colonel as all the people he knew whom he’d lost recently, lost without seeing them one last time, even in death, lost without fully being able to believe that he really had lost them because it had all happened so far away with so much in between them and him to stop him returning to pay any sort of respects to them, lost in his intellect but not his emotions, because even now, some part of him refused to believe he would never see all those lost ones again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I confess,’ Setstyin said, ‘I have no idea what form of words one ought to use on such occasions, Seer Taak. Do you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Amongst some aHumans there is a saying that we come from and go to nothing, a lack like shadow that throws the sum of life into bright relief. And with the rHumans, something about dust to ashes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Do you think she would have minded being treated as a Dweller?’ Setstyin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No,’ Fassin said. ‘I don’t think she would have minded. I think she would have felt honoured.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Here, here,’ Y’sul muttered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir gave a small formal bow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, Colonel Hatherence,’ Setstyin said, with what sounded like a sigh as he looked down at the body lying in the coffin. ‘You ascended to the age and rank of Mercatorial Colonel, which is a very considerable achievement for your kind. We think you lived well and we know you died well. You died with many others but in the end we all die alone. You died more alone than others, amongst people like you but alien to you, and far from your home and family. You fell and were found and now we send you down again, further into those Depths, to join all the revered dead on the surface of rock around the core.’ He looked at Fassin. ‘Seer Taak, would you like to say anything?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin tried to think of something. In the end he just said, ‘I believe Colonel Hatherence was a good person. She was certainly a brave one. I only knew her for less than a hundred days and she was always my military superior, but I came to like her and think of her as a friend. She died trying to protect me. I’ll always honour her memory.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He signalled that he could think of nothing else. Setstyin roll-nodded and indicated the open coffin lid.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin went forward and used a manipulator to close the casket’s iron hatch, then he lowered a little more and together he and Setstyin took one edge of the bier that the coffin lay on. They raised it, letting the heavy container slide silently off, over the edge of the balcony and down into the next bruise-dark layer of clouds, far below.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They all floated over the edge and waited until the coffin disappeared, a tiny black speck vanishing into the darkly purple wastes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Great-cousin of mine, diving deep, got hit by one of those once,’ Y’sul said thoughtfully. ‘Never knew what hit him. Stone dead.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The others were looking at him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He shrugged. ‘Well? It’s true.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Valseir found Fassin in a gallery, looking out at the deep night stream of gas, rushing quietly in infrared as the <span class="italic">Isaut</span> powered its way to who knew where.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fassin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Valseir. Are we free to leave yet?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not that I’ve heard. Not yet.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They watched the night flow round them together for a while. Fassin had spent time earlier looking at reports on the storm battle, from both sides. The Dwellers had high-selectivity visuals which made it look like the Dreadnoughts had won the day, not the <span class="italic">Isaut</span>. The little he’d got from the Mercatoria’s nets just gave dark hints that an entire fleet was missing, and included no visuals at all. Unseen was pretty much unheard-of. It appeared that everybody had instantly assumed there was some vast cover-up going on. Both sides were downplaying like crazy, implying that some terrible misunderstanding had taken place and they’d both suffered appallingly heavy losses, which was, when Fassin thought about it, somewhere between half and three-quarters true, and hence closer to reality than might have been expected in the circumstances.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So what did happen to this folder?’ Fassin asked. ‘If there was a folder.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There was and is a folder, Fassin,’ Valseir told him. ‘I held on to it for a long time but eventually, twenty-one, twenty-three years ago, I gave it to my colleague and good friend Leisicrofe. He was departing on a research trip.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Has he returned?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘When will he?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Should he return, he won’t have the data.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Where will it be?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Wherever he left it. I don’t know.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How do I find your friend Leisicrofe?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’ll have to follow him. That will not be so easy. You will need help.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I have Y’sul. He’s always arranged—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You will need rather more than he can provide.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked at the old Dweller. ‘Off-planet? Is that what you mean?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Somewhat,’ Valseir said, not looking at him, gazing out at the onward surge of night.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then who should I approach for this help?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ve already taken the liberty.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You have? That’s very kind.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir was silent for a while, then said, ‘None of this is about kindness, Fassin.’ He turned to look directly at the arrowhead. ‘Nobody in their right mind would ever want to be involved with something as momentous as this. If the slightest part of what you’re looking for has any basis in reality, it could change everything for all of us. I am a Dweller. My species has made a good, long - if selfish - life for itself, spread everywhere, amongst the stars. We do not appreciate change on the scale we are here talking about. I’m not sure that any species would. Some of us will do anything to avoid such change, to keep things just as they are.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You have to realise, Fassin; we are not a monoculture, we are not at all perfectly homogenised. We are differentiated in ways that even now, after all your exposure to us, you can scarcely begin to comprehend. There are things within our own worlds almost entirely hidden from most of us, and there are deep and profound differences of opinion between factions amongst us, just as there are between the Quick.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Factions</span>, thought Fassin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir went on, ‘Not all of us are quite so studiedly indifferent to events taking place within the greater galaxy as we generally contrive to appear. There are those of us who, without ever wanting to know the full details of your mission, in fact knowing that they’d be unable to square knowledge of its substance with their species loyalty, would help you nevertheless. Others . . . others would kill you instantly if they even began to guess what it was you’re looking for.’ The old Dweller floated over, came close to a kiss-whisper as he said, - And believe it or not, Fassin Taak, Drunisine is of the former camp, while your friend Setstyin is of the latter.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin pulled away to look at the old Dweller, who added, - Truly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After a few more moments, Fassin asked, ‘When will I be able to follow your friend Leisicrofe?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think you’ll know one way or the other before the night is out. And if we both don’t at least begin to follow Leisicrofe, we may both follow your Colonel Hatherence.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought this sounded a little melodramatic. ‘Truly?’ he asked, signalling amusement.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, truly, Fassin,’ Valseir said, signalling nothing. ‘Let me repeat: none of this is about kindness.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Saluus Kehar was not happy. He had his own people in certain places, his own ways of finding things out, his own secure and reliable channels of intelligence quite independent of the media and the official agencies - you didn’t become and stay a major military supplier unless you did - and he knew about as well as anybody did what had happened during the disastrous Nasqueron raid, and it was simply unjust to blame him or his firm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">For one thing, they’d been betrayed, or their intelligence or signals had been compromised, or at the very least they’d been out-thought (by Dwellers!). And because of that failing - which was unquestionably nothing to do with him - they’d been ambushed and out-outnumbered. Dozens of those heretofore un-fucking-heard-of super-Dreadnought ships had turned up when the incursionary force had been expecting no more than a handful - at most - of the standard ones, the models without the reactive mirror armour, the plasma engines and the wide-band lasers. Plus the Dwellers had simply done a very good job of lying over the years - years? Aeons - presenting themselves as hopeless bumblers and technological incompetents when in fact - even if they couldn’t build anything very impressive from scratch any more - they still had access to weaponry of serious lethality.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The military had fucked up. It didn’t matter how good the tool was, how clever the craftsman had been, how well-made the weapon was; if the user dropped it, didn’t switch it on or just didn’t know how to use it properly, all that good work went for nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d lost all the ships. All of them. Every single damn one, either on the raid or supporting it from space immediately above. Even a few of the ships not involved at all - those standing guard round Third Fury while the recovery and construction teams worked - had been targeted and annihilated by some sort of charged-particle-beam weapon, with two craft on the far side of the moon each chased by some type of hyper-velocity missile and blown to smithereens as well.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Unwilling to accept that they’d made a complete mess of the operation, the military had decided it mustn’t be their fault. Kehar Heavy Industries must be to blame. There must, to quote an ancient saying, be something wrong with our bloody ships. The sheer completeness of the catastrophe, and the frustrating lack of detail regarding exactly what had gone wrong, actually made it easier to blame the tool rather than the workman. All the ships had been made gas-capable by Saluus’s shipyards, all had been lost on their first mission using their new abilities, so - according to that special logic only the military mind seemed to appreciate - it must be a problem with the process of making them capable of working in an atmosphere that was responsible.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Never mind that the battlecruiser acting as Command and Control for the whole operation and both the Heavy-Armour Battery Monitors had been blasted to atoms just as effortlessly as the ships working in the planet’s clouds, even though they’d never been gas-capabled and were still in space at the time; that little detail somehow got rolled up into greater disaster and conveniently forgotten about in the hysteria.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So now they’d lost Fassin and they’d lost their lead to this Dweller List thing. Worse, they had a serious intelligence problem, because, basically, they’d been duped. The old Dweller Valseir must have suspected something or been tipped off. They knew this for the simple reason that the information he’d provided - almost the last data that had got relayed back to the top brass on Sepekte before everything went haywire - had proved, when checked later, to be a lie. The Dweller he’d told Fassin to look for in Deilte city didn’t exist. For the sake of this they’d lost over seventy first-rate warships for no gain whatsoever - ships they would seriously miss when the Beyonder/Starveling invasion hit home for real - and they’d thoroughly antagonised the Dwellers, who’d never been people it was advisable to get on the wrong side of even before they’d suddenly shown they still packed the kind of punch that could humiliate a Mercatorial fleet. As military fuck-ups went it was a many-faceted gem, a work of genius, a grapeshot, multi-stage, cluster-warhead, fractal-munition regenerative-weapon-system of a fuck-up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In fact it was only that last item on the long list of calamitous consequences - dealing with the Dwellers’ subsequent actions and signals - that had worked out less badly than it might have. Finally, something positive.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus was in a meeting. He hated meetings. They were an entirely vital part of being an industrialist, indeed of being a businessman in any sort of organisation, but he still hated them. He’d learned, partly at his father’s side, to get good at meetings, working people and information before, during and after them, but even when they were short and decided important stuff they felt like a waste of time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And they were rarely short and rarely decided important stuff.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This one wasn’t even his meeting. Unusually, he wasn’t in control. He’d been summoned. Summoned? He’d been <span class="italic">brought before</span> them. That caught the mood better.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He far preferred conference calls, holo meetings. They tended to be shorter (though not always - if you had one where everybody was somewhere they felt really comfortable, they could go on for ever too) and they were easier to control - easier to dismiss, basically. But there seemed to be this distribution curve of meeting reality: people at the bottom of the organisational pile had lots of real all-sat-down-together meetings - often, Saluus had long suspected, because they had nothing useful to do and so had the time to spare and the need to seem important that meetings could provide. Those in the middle and towards the top had more and more holo meetings because it was just more time-efficient and the people they needed to meet with were of similarly high stature with their own time problems and often far away. But then - this was the slightly weird bit - as you got to the very highest levels, the proportion of face-to-face meetings started to rise again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Maybe because it was a sign of how much you’d been able to delegate, maybe because it was a way of imposing your authority on those in the middle and upper-middle ranks beneath you, maybe because the things being discussed at high-level meetings were so important that you needed the very last nuance of physicality they provided over a holo conference to be sure that you were working with all the relevant information, including whether somebody was sweating or had a nervous tic.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This was the sort of stuff a good holo would show up, of course, though equally the sort of stuff a good pre-transmission image-editing camera would smooth away. In theory somebody in a conference call could be sitting there sweating a river and jumping like they’d been electrocuted, but if they had decent real-time image-editing facilities they could look the perfect epitome of unruffled cucumber-chill.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Though there was stuff you could do in reality, too, of course. For his thirteenth birthday, Saluus’s father had given his son a surprise party and, later, a surprise present in the shape of a visit to a Finishing Clinic, where, over the course of a long and not entirely pain-free month, they fixed his teeth, widened his eyes and altered their colour (Saluus had been womb-sculpted for the appearance he’d had, but, hey, a father could change his mind). More to the point, they made him much less fidgety, upped his capacity to concentrate and gave him control over his sweat glands, pheromone output and galvanic skin response (the last three not strictly legal, but then the clinic was owned by a subsidiary of Kehar Heavy Industries). All good for giving one an edge in meetings, discussions and even informal get-togethers. And usefully applicable to the art of seduction, too, where one’s blatant proximity to and control over astounding quantities of cash had somehow failed to have the desired effect.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This was a meeting of the Emergency War Cabinet, a high-level top-brass get-together in a klicks-deep command-bunker complex beneath one of a handful of discreetly well-guarded mansions dotted round the outskirts of greater Borquille State.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A high-level top-brass get-together minus the Hierchon Ormilla himself, however. He was patently too grand to attend a mere meeting, even of something as important as the Emergency War Cabinet, even when the fate of the System was in even greater jeopardy than it had been before the disastrous decision to go mob-handed into the atmosphere of Nasqueron the instant they thought they had a firm lead to the - anyway probably mythical - Dweller List.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And why did meetings always make his mind wander, and, specifically, make it wander towards - wander towards? Head straight for - sex?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He looked at women he was attending meetings with and found it very hard not to imagine them naked. This happened when they weren’t especially attractive, but was inevitable and often vivid if they were even slightly good-looking. Something about being able to look at them for long periods when they were talking, he suspected. Or just the urge to shuck off the whole civilised thing of being good little officers of the company and get back to being cave people again, humping in the dirt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">First Secretary Heuypzlagger was wittering. Saluus was confident that he looked like he was hanging on the First Secretary’s every word, and that his short-term memory would snick him back in should he need to return his full attention to proceedings if and when anything else of genuine import stumbled into view. But in the meantime, having already gleaned as much as he felt he was likely to regarding the real state of things from the body language and general demeanour of his fellow meeters, he felt free to let his mind wander.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He glanced at Colonel Somjomion, who was the only woman at this meeting. She didn’t tend to say very much so you didn’t get too many opportunities to look straight at her. Not especially attractive (though he was, he’d been telling himself recently, starting to appreciate women rather than girls, and see past the more obvious sexual characteristics). There was, certainly, something especially exciting about the idea of undressing a woman in uniform, but he’d long since been there and done that and had the screenage to prove it. He thought of his latest lover instead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus thought of her last night, this morning, he thought of her the night they’d first met, first slept together. He quickly got an almost painfully hard erection. They’d sculpted him to have control over that at the Finishing Clinic as well, but he usually just let things rise and fall of their own accord down there, unless either the presence or the absence was going to be socially embarrassing. Anyway, he’d long since accepted that maybe it was a way of getting back at dear old dad, for forcing all this amendment stuff on him in the first place, however useful it had proved.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He still hated meetings.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus supposed things had gone reasonably well for him in this one so far, considering. He’d had to agree to a full inquiry into the gas-capabling of the ships they’d modified as part of the general investigation into what had gone wrong, but - even allowing for the implied insult and the waste of time, just when they didn’t need it - that wasn’t too terrible. He’d managed to deflect most of the criticism by getting the Navarchy, the Guard and the Shrievalty Ocula representatives to compete for who was least to blame for the whole botched-raid thing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">That had worked well. Divide and conquer. That wasn’t difficult in the current system. In fact it was set up for it. He remembered asking his father about this back when Saluus was still being tutored at home. Why the confusion of agencies? Why the plethora (he’d just discovered the word, enjoyed using it) of military and security and other organisations within the Mercatoria? Just look at warships: there were the Guard - they had warships, the Navarchy Military - they had warships, the Ambient Squadrons - they had warships, the Summed Fleet - obviously they had warships, and then there were the Engineers, the Propylaea, the Omnocracy, the Cessorian Lustrals, the Shrievalty, the Shrievalty Ocula and even the Administrata. They all had their own ships, and each even had a few warships as well, for important escort duties. Why so many? Why divide your forces? The same went for security. Everybody seemed to have their own security service too. Wasn’t this wasteful?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, definitely,’ his father had said. ‘But there’s opportunity in waste. And what some call waste others would call redundancy. But do you really want to know what it’s all about?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Of course he did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Divide and conquer. Even amongst your own. Competition. Also even amongst your own. In fact, especially amongst your own. Keep them all at each other’s throats, keep them all watching each other, keep them all wondering what the other lot might be up to. Make them compete for your attention and approval. Yes, it’s wasteful, looked at one way, but it’s wise, looked at another. This is how the Culmina keep everything under control, young man. This is how they rule us. And it appears to work, don’t you think? Hmm?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus hadn’t been sure at the time. The sheer wastefulness of it all distressed him. He was older and wiser now and more used to the way that things really worked being more important than the way they appeared to (unless you were talking about public perception, of course, when it was the other way round).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But they really were facing a mortal and imminent threat here. Was it right to encourage division and enmity between people who and organisations which all needed to pull together if they were to defeat the threat they were faced with?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Oh, but fuck it. There would always be competition. Armed services were designed to protect turf, to engage with, to prevail against. Of course they’d compete with each other.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And, if that supposedly fucking enormous and ultimately powerful Mercatoria fleet wasn’t rushing towards them even now, would not some of the people in Ulubis - maybe quite a lot of the people in Ulubis - be contemplating not resisting the Beyonder/Starveling invasion at all? Might they not, instead, be thinking about how they could come to an accommodation with those threatening invasion?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Despite all the propaganda they’d been subject to, secret polls and secret police reports indicated that a lot of ordinary people felt they might not be any worse off under the Beyonder/Starveling forces. Some people in power would feel the same way, especially if they were being told to sacrifice property and wealth and even risk their own lives in what might turn out to be a lost cause.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Even some of those round this impressively large round table in this impressively large and cool and subtly lit board-room-resembling-meeting-chamber might have been tempted to think about ways to cope with the threatened invasion that didn’t involve resistance to the last ship and soldier, if it hadn’t been for the oncoming Mercatoria Fleet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus supposed they had to assume that the fleet really was on the way. There were other possibilities, and he’d thought them all through - and talked them all through with his own advisers and experts - but ultimately they had to be dismissed. Whether the Dweller List existed or not, everybody appeared to be acting as though it did, and that was all that mattered. It was a bit like money; all about trust, about faith. The value lay in what people believed, not in anything intrinsic.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Never mind. After covering the latest intelligence and his own shocking remissness in not making the refitted ships invulnerable to alien hyper-weapons, the meeting was finally getting round to something useful.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Back to grisly reality.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The main thing,’ Fleet Admiral Brimiaice told them (the quaup commander was keen on Main Things and In The Ends), ‘is that the Dwellers don’t seem to want to continue hostilities.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After their initial, furious take-no-prisoners attack and no-quarter polishing-off of those who’d got away, the Dwellers had just as suddenly gone back to their usual show of Shucks-us? ineptitude, claiming it had all been a terrible mistake and could they help with the Third Fury rebuild?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And thank fuck for that!’ Guard-General Thovin said. ‘If they did, we’d have absolutely no chance. Facing the Beyonder/Starveling lot and the Dwellers as well! Holy shit! No chance. No chance at all!’ Thovin was a dumpy barrel of a man, dark and powerful-looking. His voice was suitably gruff.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Instead, only almost no chance,’ Shrievalty Colonel Somjomion said with a thin smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We have every chance, madam!’ Fleet Admiral Brimiaice thundered, banging the table with one tubular armling. His splendidly uniformed and decorated body, like a well-tailored airship the size of a small hippo, rose in the air. ‘We need no defeatist talk here, of all places!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We have seventy fewer ships than we had,’ the Shrievalty colonel reminded them, without drama.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We still have the will,’ Brimiaice said. ‘That’s the important point. And we have plenty of ships. And more being built all the time.’ He looked at Saluus, who nodded and tried not to let his contempt show.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If they work,’ muttered Clerk-Regnant Voriel. The Cessorian seemed to have a personal thing against Saluus. He had no idea why.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Now, we’ve dealt with all that,’ First Secretary Heuypzlagger said quickly, glancing at Saluus. ‘If there are any problems with the ships’ construction, I’m sure the inquiry will show them up. We have to concentrate now on what else we can do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus was getting bored. Now was as good a time as any. ‘An embassy,’ he said. He looked round them all. ‘That’s what I’d like to suggest. An embassy to the Dwellers of Nasqueron, to secure peace, make sure there are no more “misunderstandings” between us and them, attempt to involve them in the defence of Ulubis system and, if possible, acquire from them - with their consent, preferably - some of the extremely impressive weaponry they appear to possess, either in physical or theoretical form.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well,’ Heuypzlagger said, shaking his head.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh. Now our Acquisitariat friend is a diplomat,’ Voriel observed, expression poised between sneer and smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Needing yet <span class="italic">more</span> supposedly gas-capable ships to protect it, no doubt!’ Brimiaice protested.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Haven’t we got one already?’ Thovin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Colonel Somjomion just looked at him, eyes narrowed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The meeting only seemed to last for ever. Finally it was over. Saluus met up with his new lover that evening, at the water-column house on Murla, where he’d first really looked at her in the true light of day and decided, yes, he’d be interested. It had been at brunch, with his wife (and her new girlfriend) and Fass and the Segrette Twins, the day after their visit to the Narcateria in Boogeytown.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The RushWing <span class="italic">Sheumerith</span> rode high in the clear gas spaces between two high haze layers, flying into the vast unending jet stream of gas as though trying to keep pace with the stars which were sometimes visible, tiny and hard and remote, through the yellow haze and the thin quick amber clouds scudding eternally overhead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The giant aircraft was a single slim scimitar of wing pocked with engine nacelles, articulated like a wave, ten kilometres across, a hundred metres long and ten metres high, a thin filament forever jetting like a swift weather front made visible across the waste of clouds beneath. Dwellers, hundreds of them, hung from it, each anchored like refuelled aircraft by a cable strung out from the wing’s trailing edge, riding in a little pocket of calm gas produced by simple shells of diamond, open to the rear and which, to the human eye, were shaped like a pair of giant cupped hands.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In a long-term drug-trance, downshifted in time so that the flight seemed twelve or sixty or more times quicker than it really was - the vast continents of clouds racing beneath like foam, the wash of stars wheeling madly above, wisp-banks whipping towards and past like rags in a hurricane - the wing-hung Dwellers watched the days and nights flicker around them like some stupendous strobe and felt the planet beneath them turn like something reeling out their lives.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin Taak left the jetclipper and flew carefully in, matching velocities, then anchored the little gascraft, very slowly, to the underside of the diamond enclosure holding the Sage-youth Zosso, a slim, dark, rather battered-looking Dweller of two million years or so.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin slow-timed. The wing, the clouds, the stars, all seemed to pick up speed, rolling racing forward like over-cranked screenage. The roar of engines and slipstreaming gas rose and rose in pitch, becoming a high, shrill, faraway keening, then vanishing from hearing altogether.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller above him, seeming to jerk and quiver in his little retaining harness, waited for him to synch before sending, - And what might you be, person?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I am a human being, sir. A Seer at the Nasqueron Court, in a gascraft, an esuit. I am called Fassin Taak, of Sept Bantrabal.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And I am Zosso, of nowhere in particular. Of here. Good view, is it not?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It is.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- However, I dare say that that is not why you are here.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You’re right. It’s not.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You wish to ask me something?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I am told I need to make passage to somewhere I’ve never heard of, to follow a Dweller I need to find. I’m told you can help.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’m sure I can, if I choose to. Well, that is, if people still take any notice of what a silly old wing-hanger says. Who can say? I’m not sure that I would listen to somebody as old and out of things as I am if I was a young travelcaptain. Why, I think I should say something like, ‘What, listen to that foolish old—?’ Oh, I beg your pardon, young human. I seem to have distracted myself. Where was it you would like to go?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A place that is, apparently, sometimes called Hoestruem.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Drunisine himself, alone, had come to the quarters that Fassin shared with the two Dwellers, in the mid-morning of the day after the battle in the storm.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We have delayed you long enough. You may go. A jetclipper is at your disposal for the next two dozen days. Goodbye.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Now there,’ Y’sul had observed, ‘goes a Dweller of few words.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hoestruem?’ Zosso asked. - No, I’ve never heard of it either.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Night swept over them as he signalled, enveloping.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- In or near Aopoleyin? Fassin sent. - Apparently, he told the old wing-hanger, when the Dweller was uncommunicative for a few moments. - Somewhere associated with Aopoleyin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">All this was on Valseir’s advice. Fassin couldn’t find any mention of anywhere called Aopoleyin in his databases either. He was starting to wonder if the memory-scanning process he’d had to undergo before being allowed to leave the <span class="italic">Isaut</span> had scrambled some of the gascraft’s information storage systems.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ah, Zosso sent. - Aopoleyin. That I have heard of. Hmm. Well, in that case, if I were you, I’d talk to Quercer &amp; Janath. Yes, you’ll need them. I should think. Tell them I sent you. Oh. And ask for my mantle scarf back. Might do the trick. No guarantees, though. Mind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Quercer and Janath. Your mantle scarf back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The old Dweller rolled a fraction, jerkily, and looked down at Fassin. - I’ll have you know it was a very good mantle scarf.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He rolled back, facing again into the never-ending rush of cloud and stars and day and night. - I could do with it up here. It’s windy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_11"></div>
