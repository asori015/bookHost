<div class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">EPILOGUE</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">There is, along the higher latitudes of the Northern Tropical Uplands of the planet-moon ’glantine, in the system of Ulubis, a bird which, thanks to its call, people call a Hey-fella-hey.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">The bird is a migrant, a passer; that is, a bird that does not dwell in the given region but only ever passes through. The Hey-fella-hey passes through these latitudes in the early spring, heading north.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">It was a cool day, mid-morning. Nasqueron, half full, cast a ruddy-brown light over the soft shadows of the day. Once, one might have seen sky mirrors away to one side or the other, bringing sunlight to us even when Nasqueron filled most of the sky above. However, many of these devices were destroyed in the war, and so our little planet-moon is a literally gloomier place now than it once was, returned, until new mirrors are emplaced, to its primitive state.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I was working in the old formal pasture, wading deep in an exasperation of chuvle weed choking a - by now - almost hidden pond and trying to work out what to do with the weed and the feature (for both are pretty in their own ways) when I heard the distinctive call of said bird. I stopped and listened.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Hey-fella-hey-fella-hey-fella-hey!’ the bird sang. I turned slowly, looking for it in the higher branches of the nearby trees.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">While I was looking - I never did locate the bird - I saw a figure walking along the high path towards the stream and the perimeter wall which gives out onto the slope holding - a little further up - the ruins of the old Rehlide temple.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I looked carefully, zooming in and trying to filter out the effects of the intervening bushes and shrubs, because the figure walked very like Seer Taak, who had been a long time gone from us. (‘Us’! - always the same, hurtful mistake. There was no ‘us’ any more, just a few sad remnants left behind at a house abandoned.) The figure disappeared behind a clump of thicker shrubbery, though they would reappear shortly if they continued to follow the path.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I thought. In retrospect, perhaps the person walking on the path had been somewhat older than the gentleman I had been pleased to think of as the young master. He was slightly stooped, which Seer Taak never had been, and he was perhaps too thin, plus he walked like somebody who had been injured in some way. So it seemed to me, at any rate. I would not claim to be an expert in such matters. I am but a humble gardener, after all. Well, a head gardener, but all the same. Still humble, I hope.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">The figure did indeed reappear, though not exactly where I had been expecting. Whoever it was had taken a side path and was now walking almost straight towards me. They raised a hand. I raised a trowel, waved back. It <span class="italic">was</span> Seer Taak! Or - by all reason - it was somebody doing their damnedest to look like a rather more aged version of him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I clambered out of the pond, shook some chuvle weed from a couple of legs, and lumbered up the path bank to meet him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Young master?’ I said, dropping trowel, rake and spade and brushing soil and weed-stems from my arms.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">The man smiled broadly. ‘HG, it is you.’ He was dressed in long, loose, casual clothes, nothing like those of a Seer.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘It is <span class="italic">you</span>, Seer Taak! We thought the worst! Oh! For you at least to be alive!’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I confess I folded, going down on all eights, staring at the gravel of the path, overcome.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">He squatted in front of me. ‘We never see what’s in front of us, do we, HG?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘HG, tell me you’re not an AI.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I looked up at him. ‘Emotion? Was that it? I should have known that would give me away one day.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">He smiled. ‘Your secret’s safe.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, perhaps for now.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Patience, HG.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘You imply that things may change? Or that I should just wait for death? We do not die easily. We have not been allowed to.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">He smiled a slow, painful smile. ‘Change, HG.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘You think?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, yes. All sorts of things are happening.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘I have heard something. They say there is a wormhole mouth, in Nasqueron?’ I looked up at the great planet which seemed to hang over us, its vast circlet rivers of gas - cream and brown, yellow, white, purple and red - forever sliding in contrary directions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">Fassin Taak nodded slowly, thoughtfully. ‘It turns out we were all connected, all the time.’ He picked up a pebble from the path, looked at it. ‘The Dwellers may even let us use their wormhole network, if we ask them nicely. Sometimes. There is a furious debate going on in Dweller society even as we speak - and probably for some time to come, Dwellers being, well, Dwellers - regarding to what extent the undying admiration of every even vaguely sentient species in the rest of the galaxy and possibly beyond could possibly constitute a general increase in the background kudos level for all Dwellers, and therefore a valid reason for throwing open their galactic transport system to all.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘That would indeed be a great change.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘And not one that the Mercatoria would be allowed to control.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘It would still be the Mercatoria.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘It can change too. It won’t have any choice. Patience, HG.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, we shall see, but thank you.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I looked at him. Fassin Taak did indeed look older. His face was more careworn, the lines around his eyes deeper. ‘Has all been well here, HG?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘All is well in the garden. The house . . . well, that is not my province.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">Now he looked down. ‘I took a look around,’ he said. His voice was quiet. ‘It was all very quiet. Very strange and quiet with nobody there.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘I try not to look at it,’ I confessed, ‘except sometimes at dawn and during the very early morning, when it looks much as it always did: bright light upon it but no sign of life. That I can bear.’ I saw the image even as I spoke of it. ‘I am lucky that I have the garden to tend. By looking after it, it looks after me.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘We all need something to do, don’t we?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">I hesitated. ‘Still, there is not a day goes by when I do not curse my luck to have been stuck here rather than with them somehow, when the end came. I envy the Head Gardener of the Winter House, where they all died together.’ I pulled myself up a fraction. ‘But enough. And you, sir? What do you do these days?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Please don’t call me “sir”, HG. I’m Fassin.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh. Thank you. Well, what are you doing? And where? If I may ask.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, I’ve gone off with the Beyonders, HG. I’m already a citizen of the galaxy, albeit slowly, without using wormholes. But, a start.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘And the Sept, Fassin?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘There is no Sept, HG. It’s gone.’ He threw the pebble back along the path. ‘Maybe they’ll start another Sept - who knows?’ He looked away in the direction of the distant house. ‘They might fill this house, one day.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘You won’t come back?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">He looked around. ‘Too many people would still want to ask me too many questions, probably until I died.’ He looked at me. ‘No, I just came back here for one last look around. And to look you up.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Really? Me? Really?’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘Really.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘I cannot tell you how gratified - no, honoured - that makes me feel.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">He smiled at me and started to rise to his feet. ‘This humility is a great cover, HG. I hope you can set it aside when the time comes.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘I meant what I said, Fassin.’</span></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4">‘And I mean this, HG,’ he said, as he brushed down his clothes, Nasqueron forever behind him. ‘One day we’ll all be free.’</span></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_14"></div>
