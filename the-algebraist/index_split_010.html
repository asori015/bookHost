<div class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">NOWHERE LEFT TO FALL</span></span></div><div class="calibre_9"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">U</span>ncle Slovius took him up on his shoulders. They were going to watch the bad machine being killed. He put his hands over Uncle Slovius’s forehead and got him to crinkle it, which felt funny and made him squirm and wriggle and laugh and meant Uncle Slovius had to hold his ankles tight to stop him falling off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fass, stop wriggling.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I fine, honest.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He already knew you were supposed to say, ‘I’m fine,’ or, ‘I am fine,’ but saying things like ‘I fine’ was better because it made adults smile and sometimes hug. Sometimes it made them put a hand on your head and make a mess of your hair, but never mind.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They went through the port door. It was spring and so that was the house they were in. He was big. He’d lived in all the houses except the Summer House. That one came next. Then he would have lived in them all. Then you started again. That was how it worked. Uncle Slovius ducked as they went through the doorway so he didn’t bash his head.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Umm, mind your head,’ he heard his dad say quietly somewhere behind him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His mum sighed. ‘Oh, stop fussing. Dear.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He couldn’t see his mum and dad because they were behind him and Uncle Slovius but he could hear them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Look, I wasn’t <span class="italic">fussing</span>, I was just—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, you—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He got that funny feeling in his tummy he got when Mum and Dad talked like that. He did a slap-a-slap-slap on Uncle Slovius’s forehead and said, ‘More about history! More about history!’ as they walked down to the flier.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Uncle Slovius laughed. The shake came up through Uncle Slovius’s shoulders into his bottom and whole body. ‘My, we are a keen student.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One word for it,’ his mother said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, come on,’ his dad said. ‘The boy’s just inquisitive.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, yes, you’re right,’ his mum said. You could hear her breath through her words. ‘My mistake. Pardon me for expressing an opinion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, now, look, I didn’t mean—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘More about Voerin!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Voehn,’ Uncle Slovius said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ve got a Voerin! I’ve got a big one that talks and climbs and swims and jumps or can walk under the water too. It’s got a gun that shoots other toys. And I’ve got lots of little ones that just move. They’ve got guns too but they’re a bit small to see but they can make each other fall over. I’ve nearly a hundred. I watch <span class="italic">Attack Squad Voerin</span> all the time! My favourite is Captain Chunce cos he’s clever. I like Commander Saptpanuhr too and Corporal Qump cos he’s funny. Jun and Yoze both like Commander Saptpanuhr best. They’re my friends. Do you watch <span class="italic">Attack Squad Voerin</span>, Uncle Slovius?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Can’t say I’ve ever caught it, Fass.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin frowned, thinking. He decided this probably meant ‘No’. Why didn’t adults just say no when they meant no?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They sat in the flier. He had to come down off Uncle Slovius’s shoulders but he got to sit beside him in the front. He didn’t even need to tell people he’d be sick if he sat in the back any more. A servant sat on the other side of him. Great-uncle Fimender was behind with two old ladies who were girlfriends. He was laughing and they were too. His mum and dad were further back, talking quiet. His mum and dad were old but Uncle Slovius was really old and Great-uncle Fimender was really, <span class="italic">really</span> old.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The flier went up into the air and went through the air making a noise like the Attack-ship <span class="italic">Avenger</span> did in <span class="italic">Attack Squad Voerin</span>. His model of the Attack-ship <span class="italic">Avenger</span> flew but only in Supervised Areas Outdoors and shot guns and missiles and made the same noise. He’d wanted to bring it with him, but not been allowed, even after he’d shouted. He hadn’t been allowed to bring any toys. No toys at all!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He pulled at Uncle Slovius’s sleeve. ‘Tell me about the Voerin!’ He tried to think what had made Uncle Slovius laugh. ‘More about history!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Uncle Slovius smiled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Voehn are the Culmina’s bully boys, child,’ said Great-uncle Fimender from the seat behind. He was leaning over. His breath had that funny sweet smell like it usually did. Great-uncle Fimender was fond of a drink. His voice was funny also sometimes, like all the words were sort of one big word. ‘I wouldn’t fixate too enthusiastically on the scum that stole our species birthright.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Steady, now, Fim,’ Uncle Slovius said. He looked round at Great-uncle Fimender but looked first at the servant except the servant didn’t move or look back or anything. ‘If the wrong person took you seriously you might find yourself joining this rogue AI. Hmm?’ He made a smile at Great-uncle Fimender, who sat back again in the seat between the old-lady girlfriends and took a glass with a drink in it from a picnic tray.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Be an honour,’ he said in a quiet voice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Uncle Slovius smiled down at Fass. ‘The Voehn went to Earth a long, long time ago, Fassin. Before humans made spaceships - before they made sea ships, almost.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How long ago?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘About eight thousand years ago.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘4051 BCE,’ Great-uncle Fimender said, though only just loud enough to hear. Uncle Slovius didn’t seem to hear. Fassin wasn’t sure if Great-uncle Fimender was disagreeing with Uncle Slovius or not. Fassin stored 4051 BCE away as an Important Number anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They met human people on Earth,’ Uncle Slovius said, ‘and took them away with them on their ship, to other stars and planets.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Kidnapping the prims!’ Great-uncle Fimender said. ‘Sampling the barbs, with prejudice! Eh?’ He didn’t sound like he was talking to him and Uncle Slovius. Fass didn’t understand what Great-uncle Fimender was saying anyway. The old-lady girlfriends were laughing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well,’ Uncle Slovius said, with a small smile, ‘who’s to say whether humans were kidnapped or not? People in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and China were too primitive to know what was going on. They probably thought the Voehn were gods, so they might have gone with them without being kidnapped and we don’t even know that the Voehn took whole people. Maybe they just took their cells.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Or babies, or foetuses, or excised a few thousand fertilised eggs,’ Great-uncle Fimender said. Then, ‘Oh, thank you, my dear. Oops! Steady, there.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘In any event,’ Uncle Slovius said, ‘the Voehn took some human people and put them down on planets far away from Earth and the human people grew up with other people, and the Culmina had the other people help the humans so that they became civilised quickly, and invented all the things humans back on Earth ever invented, but these human people on the other planets always knew they were part of a galactic community, hmm?’ Uncle Slovius looked at him with a question-look on his face. Fass nodded quickly. He knew what a galactic community meant: everybody else.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Anyway, people on Earth kept on inventing things, and eventually invented wormholes and portals—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Attack-ship <span class="italic">Avenger</span> goes through wormholes and portals,’ he told Uncle Slovius.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course,’ Uncle Slovius said. ‘And so when human people went out and met other alien people and joined their wormhole up with everybody else’s wormhole, they found out that they weren’t the first humans the alien people had met or had heard of, because the humans who had been taken away to the other planets by the Voehn were already quite well known.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Remainder</span> humans,’ Great-uncle Fimender said from the seat behind. His voice sounded funny, like he might be going to burst out laughing or something.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Uncle Slovius looked round at him for a short bit. ‘Well, the terms don’t matter too much, even if they might sound a little harsh sometimes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Carefully chosen to keep us in our place, remind us we owe them, either way,’ Great-uncle Fimender said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Culmina tell us they had people look after Earth after the Voehn took the humans away to the other stars. They made sure that nothing bad happened to Earth, like it being hit by a big rock.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Great-uncle Fimender made a sort of cough-laugh. ‘Easy to claim.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fass looked round at Great-uncle Fimender. He sort of wanted Great-uncle Fimender to be quiet so he could listen to Uncle Slovius but sort of didn’t because the things Great-uncle Fimender was saying, even if he didn’t always understand all of them, seemed to be saying things about the things Uncle Slovius was saying. It was like they sort of agreed and didn’t agree at the same time. Great-uncle Fimender winked at him and gestured towards Uncle Slovius with his glass. ‘No, no; listen!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So, people from Earth got into the stars at last and found that there were aliens everywhere,’ Uncle Slovius told him. ‘And some of them were us!’ He smiled a broad smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And there were a lot more of the alien humans than there were of the ones who thought <span class="italic">they</span> were humanity,’ Great-uncle Fimender said. It sounded like he was sneering. Uncle Slovius sighed and looked ahead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The flier was flying over mountains with snow on them. In front was a big bit of desert like a circle. Uncle Slovius shook his head and didn’t seem to want to say anything but Great-uncle Fimender did so Fass turned round in his seat and listened to him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And they were more technically advanced, these so-called aHumans. Advanced but cowed. Servant species, just like everybody else. While all Earth’s dreams of wild expansion were made to look like so much belly-gas. The answer to “Where is everybody?” turned out to be, “Everywhere”, but the stake at the galactic poker game is a wormhole and so we had to fund our own and bring that to the table. Then discover that Everywhere really meant Everywhere, and every damn thing you could see and every damn thing you couldn’t belonged to some bugger: every rock, every planet, moon and star, every comet, dust cloud and dwarf, even the bloody null-foam of space itself was somebody’s home. Land on some godforsaken cinder, pull out a shovel thinking you could dig something, build something or make something of it and next thing you know an alien with two heads was poking both of them out of a burrow and telling you to fuck off, or pointing a gun at you. Or a writ - ha! Worse still!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d never heard Great-uncle Fimender talk so much. He wasn’t sure that Great-uncle Fimender was really talking to Uncle Slovius or to him or even to his two old-lady girlfriends because he wasn’t looking at any of them, he was looking at the picnic table hinged down from the seat in front, maybe looking at the glass and the decanter bottle on it, and looking sad. The two old-lady girlfriends patted him and one smoothed his hair which was very black indeed but still looked old.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Prepping, they call it,’ he said, maybe to himself or maybe to the picnic table. ‘Bloody kidnapping.’ He snorted. ‘Putting people in their place, holding them there. Letting us build our dreams then puncturing them.’ He shook his head, and drank from his shiny glass.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Prepping?’ Fass asked, to make sure he had the word right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm? Oh, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, it’s something that’s gone on for as long as anybody can remember,’ Uncle Slovius said. He sounded gentle, and Fass wasn’t sure if Uncle Slovius was talking to him or to Great-uncle Fimender. He sort of half-listened while he pulled out one of the flier’s screens. If he’d been allowed to bring any toys he’d definitely have brought his BotPal and just asked, but now these damn adults were making him use a screen. He stared at the letters and numbers and things (Uncle Slovius and Great-uncle Fimender were still talking).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He didn’t want to have to talk, he wanted to tap-in like adults did. He tried a few buttons. After a while he got a lots-of-books symbol with a big kid standing next to it and an ear symbol. The big kid looked scruffy and was holding a drug bowl and his head was surrounded with lines and little moving satellites and flying birds. Oh well.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Prepping,’ he said, but pressed <span class="italic">Text</span>. The screen said:</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_10"><div class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>PREPPING. A very long-established practice, used lately by the <span><span class="underline">Culmina</span></span> amongst others, is to take a few examples of a <span><span class="underline">pre-civilised species</span></span> from their <span><span class="underline">home world</span></span> (usually in <span><span class="underline">clonoclastic</span></span> or <span><span class="underline">embryonic</span></span> form) and make them <span><span class="underline">subject species/slaves/mercenaries/mentored,</span></span> so that when the people from their home world finally assume the <span><span class="underline">Galactic stage,</span></span> they are not the most <span><span class="underline">civilised</span></span> /<span><span class="underline">advanced</span></span> of their kind (often they’re not even the most numerous <span><span class="underline">grouping</span></span> of their kind). Species so treated are expected to feel an obligation to their so-called <span><span class="underline">mentors</span></span> (who will also generally claim to have diverted <span><span class="underline">comets</span></span> or otherwise prevented <span><span class="underline">catastrophes</span></span> in the interim, whether they have or not). This practice has been banned in the past when <span><span class="underline">pan-Galactic laws</span></span> (see <span><span class="underline">Galactic Council)</span></span> have been upheld but tends to reappear in less civilised times. Practice variously referred to as Prepping, <span><span class="underline">Lifting</span></span> or <span><span class="underline">Aggressive Mentoring.</span></span> Local-relevant terminology: <span><span class="underline">aHuman</span></span> &amp; <span><span class="underline">rHuman</span></span> (advanced and remainder <span><span class="underline">Human)</span></span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div></span></div></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And that was just the start. He scratched his head. Too many long words. And this wasn’t even an adult pedia. Maybe he should have found the not-so-big kids’ site.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were landing. Wow! He hadn’t even noticed they were near the ground. The desert was covered with fliers of different sizes and there were lots in the air too and lots of people.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They got out and walked across the sand though a lot of people stayed in their fliers. He got to go on Uncle Slovius’s shoulders again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Away in the distance in the centre of a big circle was a tower with a big blob on top and that was where the bad machine was which had been found hiding in a cave in the mountains and caught by the Cessoria. (The Cessoria and the Lustrals caught bad machines. He’d tried watching <span class="italic">Lustral Patrol</span> a few times but it was too much for old people with talk and kissing.)</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The bad machine in the blob on top of the big tower was allowed to make a speech but it was too full of long words. He was getting bored and it was very hot. No toys! Uncle Slovius said ‘Shush’ at him, twice. He sort of tried to pretend-strangle Uncle Slovius with his thighs and knees to get back at him for going ‘Shush’ twice, but Uncle Slovius didn’t seem to notice. Mum and Dad were still talking quietly, rolling their eyes and shaking their heads at each other as usual. Great-uncle Fimender and the two old-lady girlfriends had stayed in the flier.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then Lustrals in a flier - humans and a whule like a big grey bat - said things, then at last it was time and the bad machine was killed but even that wasn’t very good, the blob on top of the tower just went red and made lots of smoke and then there was a big bright flash but not that big or bright and then there was a bang and bits fell down, with smoke, and some people cheered but mostly there was silence, just the bang being an echo round the mountains.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When they got back to the flier Great-uncle Fimender had very red eyes and said in his opinion they had just seen a terrible crime committed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Ah, young Taak. Now then, what is this nonsense about not being able to delve properly, by which of course one means remotely?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Braam Ganscerel, Chief Seer of Sept Tonderon and therefore the most senior Seer of all - and Fassin’s future paterfamilias-in-law - was tall and thin and maned in white hair. He looked younger than he was, but then he was nearly seventeen hundred years old by the most obvious way of reckoning such matters. He had a sharp, angular face with a large nose, his skin was pale, waxy and translucent and his fingers and hands were long and fragile-seeming. He habitually walked and stood with his head back and chest out, as though he had long ago vowed not to appear stooped as he grew into great old age and had gone too far in the other direction. This curious stance meant that his head was angled so far back on his neck that he had no choice but to look down his splendidly monumental nose at those he talked with, to or at. He held two long shining black staffs as though just returned from - or about to set off for - some particularly fashionable ski slopes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">With his long, bunned white hair, pale complexion and simple but elegantly cut Seer robes - black puttees, pantaloons and long jacket - he contrived to look appealingly frail, sweetly elderly, breathtakingly distinguished and only a little less authoritative than a supreme deity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He swept into the senior officers’ mess of the heavy cruiser <span class="italic">Pyralis</span> in a clatter of clicks from his twin staffs and boot heels, attended by a pale train of half a dozen junior Seers - half of them men, half of them women, all of them greyly deferential - and, bringing up the rear, the gangly, smiling form of Paggs Yurnvic, a Seer whom Fassin had helped teach but who, having spent less time subsequently in the slowness of actual delving than Fassin had, was now older in both adjusted time and appearance.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Chief Seer,’ Fassin said, standing and executing a formal nod that just avoided being a bow. The heavy cruiser was taking their party to Third Fury, the close-orbit moon of Nasqueron from which they would delve - either all remotely, or, if Fassin had his way, through a combination of remote and direct presences.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Braam Ganscerel had insisted that his years and frailty made a high-gee journey to the moon out of the question - esuits, life-pods and shock-gel notwithstanding - and so the ship was making a gentle standard one gee, creating what felt like about twice ’glantine’s gravity and a fraction less than Sepekte’s. Even this standard gee, Braam Ganscerel let it be known, necessitated that he use both his staffs to support himself. This was, however, in the current grave circumstances, a sacrifice he felt it was only right and proper and indeed required that he make. Fassin thought it made him look like a stilter, like a whule.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well?’ the Chief Seer demanded, stopping in front of Fassin. ‘Why can’t you remote delve, Fassin? What’s wrong with you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fear, sir,’ Fassin told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fear?’ Braam Ganscerel seemed to experiment with putting his head even further back than it already was, found it was possible, and left it there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fear of being shown up by you, sir, as a merely competent Slow Seer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Braam Ganscerel half-closed one eye. He looked at Fassin for a while. ‘You’re mocking me, Fassin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin smiled. ‘I delve better direct, Braam. You know that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I do,’ Ganscerel said. He turned with a sort of staccato grace and let himself flop into the couch where Fassin had been sitting, watching screen news. Fassin sat too. Paggs perched on one arm of the next-nearest couch and the rest of Braam Ganscerel’s retinue sited themselves nearby according to some arcane pecking order.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin nodded at Paggs. ‘Seer Yurnvic,’ he said with a smile and a formality he hoped Paggs wouldn’t take seriously.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Paggs grinned. ‘Good to see you, Fass.’ That was all right, then.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘However, we must do this together, I believe,’ Braam Ganscerel said, looking ahead at the wall screen, where the news went silently on. The funerals were taking place of some more of the Navarchy people who’d died in the attack on the dock-habitat at Sepekte’s trailing Lagrange. Ganscerel had let one of his twin staffs rest on the couch beside him, but still held the other. He waved it at the screen and it obligingly went back to being a bulkhead again. The heavy cruiser’s senior officers’ mess was a large space, but much broken up by vertical columns and diagonal reinforcing struts. Like the rest of the vessel it was quite comfortable by human standards, though Colonel Hatherence had had to be content with a cabin that was extremely cramped for an oerileithe. She had been offered passage on an escorting cruiser with more suitable accommodation but had declined.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We can be together,’ Fassin said. ‘You and Paggs remotely, the Colonel and I directly. That way we’re backed up so if anything happens to either group—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah,’ Ganscerel said. ‘You see, young Taak, this is the point. If we are all on Third Fury, with this fine vessel and its escort craft to protect us, we shall all be safe. You wish to take a tiny gascraft into the unending violence of the planet’s atmosphere. A dangerous enterprise at the best of times. In wartime, positively foolhardy.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Braam, the old portal was protected by an entire fleet and it still got blasted. Third Fury might move, but it moves very predictably. If somebody did want to attack it they could accelerate a small rock to just under light speed and send it on an intercept course. If that happens, the only way a heavy cruiser is going to help is if by some million-to-one chance it happens to be in the way at the time and takes the hit itself. As nobody’s going to surround the entire moon with a shell of ships, I think it’s unwise to rely on a few war craft to protect us from something there’s almost no defence against.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why would anybody target a moonlet like Third Fury?’ Paggs asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Indeed,’ Ganscerel said, as though he had been just about to ask that very question.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No good reason,’ Fassin said. ‘But then a lot of places there’s been no good reason to hit have been getting attacked recently.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This might well include Nasqueron itself,’ Ganscerel pointed out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Which can absorb a lot more punishment than Third Fury.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You might still be targeted.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If I’m in there in a gascraft, even with Colonel Hatherence riding shotgun, I should be effectively untraceable,’ Fassin told them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Unless,’ Paggs said, ‘she’s supposed to be in constant touch with her superiors.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And that might be the real reason we are all expected to stay together on Third Fury, delving remotely,’ Ganscerel said, sighing. He looked at Fassin. ‘Control. Or at least the illusion of it. Our masters are fully aware how important this mission is, even if they think themselves for the moment above explaining its precise nature to all who need to know. They are naturally terrified that if it goes wrong some of the blame will stick to them. Really, it is all up to us: a bunch of academics they’ve never particularly cared about or for, even though -’ Ganscerel looked round the assembled junior Seers ‘- being a centre of Dweller Studies represents the only thing which makes Ulubis in any way remarkable.’ He directed his gaze on Fassin again. ‘There is very little they can do, therefore they will attend with extreme diligence to what trivial matters they are able to affect. With us all apparently safe on Third Fury protected by a small fleet of warships, they will feel they are doing all they can to assist us. If they let you go down into Nasqueron, and something does go wrong, they will be blamed. In that they are right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It won’t work, Braam.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think we have to try,’ the older man said. ‘Look.’ He patted Fassin’s arm. Fassin was dressed in his Shrievalty major’s uniform and feeling awkward amidst fellow Seers. ‘Have you tried remote delving recently?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not for a long time,’ Fassin admitted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s changed,’ Paggs said, nodding. ‘It’s much more lifelike, if you know what I mean; more convincing.’ Paggs smiled. ‘There have been a lot of improvements over the last couple of centuries. Largely thanks to the Real Delving movement, frankly.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh, Paggs, flattery?</span> Fassin thought.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ganscerel patted his arm again. ‘Just try it, will you, Fassin? Will you do that for me?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin didn’t want to say yes immediately. <span class="italic">This is all beside the point</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Even if I didn’t know there was a potential threat to Third Fury, the argument that matters is that the Dwellers we need to talk to just won’t take us seriously if we turn up in remotes. It’s about respect, about us taking risks, sharing their world with them, really being there</span>. But he mustn’t seem intransigent. Keep some arguments back; always have reserves. After a moment he nodded slowly. ‘Very well. I’ll do that. But only as a trial delve. A day or two. That’ll be enough to feel any difference. Then we have to make a final decision.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ganscerel smiled. They all did.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They had a very pleasant dinner with the senior officers of the small fleet taking them to Third Fury.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin got Ganscerel alone at one point. ‘Chief Seer,’ he said. ‘I will do this remote delve, but if I feel it’s not good enough I’m going to have to insist on going direct.’ He gave Ganscerel space to say something, but the old man just looked him in the eye, head thrown back. ‘I do have authority,’ Fassin continued. ‘From the briefing, from Admiral Quile and the Complector Council. I realise it’s been compromised by people in-system coming to their own conclusions about the best way to tackle this problem, but if I think I need to, I’ll go as high and wide as I can to get my way.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ganscerel thought for a while, then smiled. ‘Do you think this delve - or delves, this mission - will be successful?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, Chief Seer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Neither do I. However, we must make the attempt and do all we can to make it successful, even so, and even though failure is probably guaranteed. We must be seen to do what we can, attempt not to offend those above us, and aim to protect the good name and the future prospects of the Slow Seers in general. These things we can definitely do. You agree?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So far, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If you genuinely believe that you must delve directly, I shall not stand in your way. I shall not back you, either, because to do that in my position would be to tie myself too directly to a course of action I still regard as fundamentally foolhardy. In any other set of circumstances I would simply order you to do as your most senior Chief Seer tells you to do. However, you have been instructed from on high - from extremely on high - Fassin Taak, and that does alter things somewhat. However. Try this remote delve. You might be surprised. Then make your own mind up. I won’t stand in your way. The responsibility will be entirely yours. You have my full support in that.’ With a wink, Ganscerel turned away to talk to the heavy cruiser’s captain.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin reflected that being given full support had never felt so much like being hung out to dry.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The <span class="italic">Pyralis</span> blazed with its own trailed aurora as it entered the protective magnetombra of Third Fury, a little twenty-kilometre-wide ball of rock and metal orbiting just 120,000 kilometres above Nasqueron’s livid cloud tops. The gas-giant filled the sky, so close that its rotund bulk took on the appearance of a vast wall, its belts and zones of tearing, swirling, ever-eddying clouds looking like colossal contra-rotating, planet-wide streams of madly coloured liquid caught whirling past each other under perfectly transparent ice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Third Fury had no appreciable atmosphere and only the vaguest suggestion of gravity. The heavy cruiser could almost have docked directly with the Seer base complex on the side of the little moon which always faced Nasqueron. However, a troop landing craft took them from one to the other. The <span class="italic">Pyralis</span> lay a few kilometres off, effectively another temporary satellite of the gas-giant. Its escort of two light cruisers and four destroyers took up station a few tens of kilometres further out in a complicated cat’s cradle of nested orbits around the moon, slim slow shadow shapes only glimpsed when they passed in front of the planet’s banded face.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Third Fury had been constructed, or converted, from an already existing moonlet, billions of years earlier, by one of the first species to pay homage at the court of the Nasqueron Dwellers. Given that Dwellers were the most widespread of the planet-based species of the galaxy, with a presence in almost all gas-giants - themselves the most common type of planets - the fact that out of those ninety million-plus Dweller-inhabited super-globes there were exactly eight with populations willing to play host to those wishing to carry on more than the most fleeting conversation with their inhabitants spoke volumes - indeed, appropriately, libraries - about their almost utter lack of interest in the day-to-day life of the rest of the galactic community.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was, though, only <span class="italic">almost</span> utter; the Dwellers were not perfectly anything, including reclusive. They sought, gathered and stored vast quantities of information, albeit with no discernible logical system involved in the acquisition or the storage, and when quizzed on the matter seemed not only completely unable to present any obvious or even obscure rationale for this effectively mindless accumulation of data, but even genuinely puzzled that the question should be asked at all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There had also, throughout recorded time - even discounting the notoriously unreliable records kept on such matters by the Dwellers themselves - always been a few of their populations available for discourse and informational trading, though this was invariably only granted on the eccentric and capricious terms of the Dwellers. Since the end of the First Diasporian Age, when the galaxy and the universe were both around two and a half billion years old, there had never been no working centres of Dwellers Studies, but in the following ten and a half billion years there had never been more than ten such centres operating at any one time either.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Acceptable companions came and went.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dwellers were of the Slow, the category of species that stuck around in a civilised form for at least millions of years. The people they let come and visit them and talk to them, and with whom they were prepared to trade information, were usually numbered amongst the Quick, the kind of species that often counted its time as a civilised entity in tens of thousands of years, and sometimes not even that long. The Dwellers would tolerate and talk to other Slow species as well, though normally on a less regular and frequent basis. The suspicion was that the Dwellers, for all their fabled patience - no species colonised the galaxy at speeds averaging less than one per cent of the speed of light (not counting stopovers) unless it was supremely patient - could get bored with the species that came to talk to them, and by selecting only those numbered amongst the Quick they ensured that they would never have to endure for too long a time the attentions of people they only looked forward to seeing the back of. Just wait a bit and - in a twinkling of an eye by Dweller standards - their troublesome guests would evolve out of nuisancehood.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">For the last sixteen hundred years or so - barely half a Dweller eye-twinkling - humans had been adjudged as acceptable confidants for the Dwellers of Nasqueron in the system of Ulubis, their presence mostly tolerated, their company usually accepted, their safety almost always guaranteed and their attempts to talk to the Dwellers and mine their vast but defiantly imaginatively organised and indexed data shales met with only the most formal of obstructiveness, the lighter forms of derision and the least determinedly obfuscatory strategies.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">That such playful coynesses, such nearly-too-small-to-measure diffidences and such gentle, barely-meriting-the-name hindrances appeared to the humans concerned to be obstacles of monumental scale, hideous complexity and inexhaustibly fiendish invention just went to show who’d been doing this for most of the lifetime of the universe and who for less than two thousand years.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Other approaches had, of course, been tried.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Bribing creatures who found the concept of money merely amusing tended to tax even the most enterprising and talented arbitrageur. The Dwellers clove to a system in which power was distributed, well, more or less randomly, it sometimes seemed, and authority and influence depended almost entirely on one’s age; little leverage there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Alternatively, every now and again a species would attempt to take by force of arms what those involved in Dweller Studies attempted to wrest from the Dwellers by polite but dogged inquiry. Force, it had been discovered - independently, amazingly often - did not really work with Dwellers. They felt no pain, held their own continued survival (and that of others, given the slightest provocation) to be of relatively little consequence and seemed to embody, apparently at the cellular level, the belief that all that really mattered, ever, was a value unique to themselves which they defined as a particular kind of kudos, one of whose guiding principles appeared to be that if any outside influence attempted to mess with them they had to resist it to the last breath in the bodies of all concerned, regardless.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dwellers were almost everywhere and had been there practically for ever. They had learned a few things about making war over that time, and while their war machines were believed to be as customarily unreliable - and eccentrically designed, built and maintained - as every other piece of technology they deigned to involve themselves with, that didn’t mean they weren’t deadly; usually for all concerned, and within a disconcertingly large volume.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Other species had prevailed against Dwellers on occasion. Entire planetary populations of them had been wiped out and whole gas-giants dismantled to provide the raw material for one of those monstrous megastructure projects that Quick species in particular seemed so keen on building, apparently just because they could. But the long-term results were, to date, inevitably unhappy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Picking a fight with a species as widespread, long-lived, irascible and - when it suited them - single-minded as the Dwellers too often meant that just when - or even geological ages after when - you thought that the dust had long since settled, bygones were bygones and any unfortunate disputes were all ancient history, a small planet appeared without warning in your home system, accompanied by a fleet of moons, themselves surrounded with multitudes of asteroid-sized chunks, each of those riding cocooned in a fuzzy shell made up of untold numbers of decently hefty rocks, every one of them travelling surrounded by a large landslide’s worth of still smaller rocks and pebbles, the whole ghastly collection travelling at so close to the speed of light that the amount of warning even an especially wary and observant species would have generally amounted to just about sufficient time to gasp the local equivalent of ‘What the fu—?’ before they disappeared in an impressive if wasteful blaze of radiation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Retaliation, where it was still possible, and on the few occasions it had been tried, led without fail towards a horribly messy war of attrition, whereupon the realisation of the sheer scale of the Dweller civilisation (if one could even call it that) and its past - and therefore probably future - longevity more often than not had a sobering effect on whatever species had been unwise enough to set themselves against the Dwellers in the first place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Attempting to hold your local Dweller population hostage in the hope of influencing another one - or a group of others - was an almost laughably lame and even counter-productive strategy. Dwellers of any given gas-giant thought little enough of their own collective safety; giving them an excuse to show how little solidarity they felt with any other group of their own kind only led to events of particular and spectacular grisliness, for all that the genetic and cultural variation between Dweller populations was much less than that displayed by any other galaxy-wide grouping.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The long, long-arrived-at consensus, particularly amongst those still nursing civilisational bruises from earlier encounters with what was arguably one of the galaxy’s most successful species, or those with the images of what had happened to others still fresh in their data banks, was that, on balance, it was best just to leave the Dwellers alone.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Left to themselves the Dwellers disturbed nobody except occasionally themselves and those who thought too deeply about what they really represented. Their history, after all, like that of the galaxy as a whole, was one of almost but not quite uninterrupted peace and tranquillity: billions and billions of years of thankfully nothing much happening at all. In over ten billion years of civilisation there had been only three major Chaoses and the number of genuine galaxy-spanning wars didn’t even make it into double figures. In base eight!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">That was a record that the Dwellers seemed to feel everybody concerned ought to feel mildly proud of. Especially themselves.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Welcome all! Chief Seer, good to see you! Seer Taak, Seer Yurnvic. Young friends. And this must be Colonel Hatherence. Pleased to make your acquaintance, ma’am.’ Duelbe, the bald, nearly spherical major-domo of the Third Fury Shared Facility, greeted them in the transit hall as the military troop carrier disengaged and turned back towards the <span class="italic">Pyralis</span>. A couple of the youngest Seers, who had patently never encountered the positively ball-like form of Duelbe before, stared. It was as a rule at such moments that comparisons regarding the similarity in shape of Third Fury and the major-domo of its Shared Facility came to mind. Happily, on this occasion, if they were thought they went unvoiced.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Servants took charge of luggage pallets. Hatherence shooed away retainers who offered to help her manoeuvre in the relatively confined space - the dome-like hall, like the rest of the mostly underground facility, had been rebuilt on a human scale since the departure of the last species to be granted Seer status, with little spatial concession to other, effectively larger species. Colonel Hatherence was happy to float where she could without assistance, thank you, using trim-vanes on the outside of her discus of esuit to propel her from place to place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah!’ Braam Ganscerel announced loudly, bouncing along the hall’s floor in long floating strides, idly fending himself off the ceiling above with casual prods of one staff like some strangely graceful, if inverted, pole vaulter. ‘<span class="italic">That</span>’s better! One rarely appreciates gravity so much as when faced with so little of it, eh, Duelbe?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The major-domo smiled broadly, even though Fassin knew he must have heard the old man say this a dozen times or more. The retinue of junior Seers apparently hadn’t, and gave every impression of being barely able to contain their hearty guffaws within their aching sides.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The three double discs soared above a great curved canyon of cloud sliced deep within what looked like a convex bank of blood-red snow a hundred kilometres high. Much further above, a sky of rushing yellow streamers afforded brief glimpses of a wanly cerise sky, dotted with the spike-points of stars and, occasionally, a single, visibly sky-crossing moon like a soft brown snowball. The formation of flying machines curved across towards the blood-red bank of vapour and disappeared into it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Senses shifted. He felt himself reaching out with a slick effortlessness into mag and rad, grav-grad and radio, pulling in a composite picture of his environment thousands of kilometres in diameter and hundreds deep, placing him with pin-sharp clarity in a great reticulated accumulation of magnetic fields, radiation and gravitational gradient, all overlaid on the wide-light image still available and the jelly-like ghost-vista of soundscape.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Still taking the lead from Paggs, leading the trio, they dived towards a sharp thermocline coming into view a dozen klicks down.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They flew out into a wide bubble of relative sight-clarity, then into a squall of water snow. They dived deeper, through a band of pressure and temperature where water rain fell, pattering hard against the skins of their whirling double discs, then on down, down into even wide-light darkness, down to the warm hydrogen slush where the discs floated like giant double-cone yo-yos, bobbing, steaming, flickering signals to each other.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So, what do you think, young Taak? Good to be home?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- A fascinating experience, Fassin agreed. - We’re, what? He double checked his internal navigation instrumentation. - Two equatorial sats along and a band up?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Now, Fass, Paggs began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- So if I do this - Fassin sent, and lunged his double disc towards Paggs’s. Paggs had guessed what was coming and already started to move away, flinching backwards and up. Fassin’s machine seemed to dart towards the other Seer’s remote craft, then draw back, stopping just short of where Paggs’s machine had been. - You’ve got just enough time to get out of the way, Fassin pointed out reasonably.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Seer Taak . . . Braam Ganscerel began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Whereas if I did something similar on the far side of the planet, Fassin continued, - at the far end of a whole chain of sats, the best part of a full light second away even without any processing delays, we might both now be listening to our remotes telling us that, at best, I just voided their warranties.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin, Ganscerel sent with a sigh. - I think we’re all aware of the speed of light and the diameter of the planet. And these remotes are anyway not completely stupid, or unprotected. They have an extremely sophisticated collision-avoidance system built into them. One we had to clear specifically with your friends in the Shrievalty to have built in, it’s so close to . . . to being <span class="italic">clever</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- But if a Dweller points a laser at you for fun, Fassin asked, - just to see if you’ll flinch, what good is any collision-avoidance system to you then?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Perhaps, Ganscerel suggested mellowly, - one ought not to mix with the kind of Dweller who would be likely to act in such a manner in the first place.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Except they’re the ones that are most likely to share interesting stuff with you, old man, not the desiccated, harmless but clueless pixie-brains you tend to spend your time flattering</span>, Fassin thought. He was fairly certain that it was just a thought. People always worried that in theory in VR you might say something you only meant to think, but he wasn’t so rusty in the techniques of remote delving that he was truly concerned. It might, anyway, even do Braam Ganscerel some good to hear a few politely unspeakable things now and again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Perhaps, indeed, Chief Seer, was all he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm. Let’s step out, shall we?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>They returned to the reality of a remote-send suite buried deep in the Third Fury Facility, blinking in the light as technicians helped to unclip them from the couches, pushing themselves forward to clear the half-domes of the NMR assemblages, handing back earpieces and simple black velvet blindfolds, flexing and stretching as though they’d been under for a genuinely long delve rather than a mere hour or so at a one-to-one time ratio.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Paggs worked his fingers, undoing the last couple of soft tabs that connected him to the thin pneumo-tubes which had both sensed his movements and would have prevented him from throwing himself right off the couch in the event that he’d performed any especially energetic actions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ganscerel lay with his eyes closed, breathing deeply and letting the technicians detach him from the machinery.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Paggs glanced over. ‘Are we convincing you at all, Fass?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’re convincing me it’s even easier to remote delve these days than it used to be.’ Fassin levered himself from the couch with the steady application of force from one small finger and let himself float very gently towards the floor. ‘I would have taken your word for it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">‘So, you only got one-third of the volumes concerned, young Taak,’ Ganscerel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was giving a very private briefing in an engineering store off the secondary ship hangar. Ganscerel had wanted it conducted in his quarters but there wasn’t a way of squeezing the colonel in there. Present were Fassin, Ganscerel, Paggs and Colonel Hatherence. Fassin wanted them each to know as much as he did - or at least as much as he thought they ought to know - about what he had found on his long-ago delve and what they would be looking for on the one they were hoping to begin the following day.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I traded some high-definition images of Earth Twentieth-Century European Expressionist paintings for - amongst a lot of other stuff - what was catalogued as a tri-translated text of a pre-Third Chaos Lutankleydar epic poem, a private, unpublished work by - or perhaps commissioned by - a Doge of the Enigmatics. It was all double-encrypted and compressed but it was known to be in three volumes. I got three volumes from Valseir, only - as it turned out years later, when it was finally de-mangled by the Jeltick - what I’d been given wasn’t Volumes One, Two and Three. It was Volume One, three times over, in three separate languages. And it wasn’t by an Enigmatic Doge either.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One of the volumes was in a previously known but untranslatable Penumbral language from the time of the Summation. When the translation was made it acted as a Rosetta; gave the key to a lot of other stuff, and that side-tracked everybody for a while. Then some pin-eyed Jeltick scholar spotted a note at the end, buried in the appendices in a crude but related slang-language, obviously added later, but not much later, that basically said the whole thing had been written during the Long Crossing of the Second Ship, by an Outcast Dweller skilled in the Penumbral language, and that, yes, of course there was a Dweller List, they - the ship, or its crew - had the key to it, and it would be included in Volume Two or Three of this epic poem. It was also, of course, in the ship, and the ship was heading for the Zateki system. That’s why the Jeltick sent an expedition straight there as soon as they had the translation.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why not come here, to Nasqueron, where they might have found the Third Volume?’ Paggs asked, smiling.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Because the Shrievalty hadn’t told them where the data had come from. Whether this was oversight or deliberate we haven’t been told. The Jeltick may have guessed it was from a Dweller Studies centre but they couldn’t be sure whether it was or not and, if so, which one. They probably did start making inquiries, but they didn’t want to alert anybody else to the importance of what they had. Don’t forget, the information had been copied and re-copied - it was lying about in data reservoirs all over the civilised galaxy. Quite possibly people had even already translated and read the main text but just hadn’t got round to the appendices, where the all-important note was. The slightest hint that there was anything of strategic interest in that tranche and everybody else would have dusted it off, read it and - bang - the Jeltick would have lost their edge. So they fuelled and tooled and set sail for Zateki instead.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This could all be a hoax, you know,’ Ganscerel said, snorting. He adjusted his robes, frowning deeply. ‘I do believe I detect the laboured and tortuous signature of Dweller humour here. This could just be a joke at the expense of anyone foolish enough to fall for it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It could indeed, sir,’ Fassin agreed. ‘But we have our orders and we have to make the effort, just in case it is all true.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So we are looking for the remaining two volumes of this . . . what is it called, exactly?’ Colonel Hatherence asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Best translation,’ Fassin said, ‘is, <span class="italic">The Algebraist</span>. It’s all about mathematics, navigation as a metaphor, duty, love, longing, honour, long voyages home . . . all that stuff.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And what is or was this Long Crossing?’ Ganscerel asked irascibly. ‘I haven’t heard of it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The voyage back home from what humans used to call the Triangulum Nebula,’ Fassin said, with a small smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well,’ Ganscerel said, frowning once more. ‘We are not really much further forward, are we? And what, pray, do we call the Triangulum Nebula now, Seer Taak?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We call it the Lost Souls II Galaxy, Chief Seer. The crossing was called the Long Crossing because it took thirty million years. The outward journey allegedly took almost no time, because it was conducted through an intergalactic wormhole, the portal location of which is amongst those included in the Dweller List.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Hervil Apsile, Master Technician of the Third Fury Shared Facility, ran the ultrasonic hand-held over the gascraft’s starboard nacelle one more time, smiling with some satisfaction at the smooth line on the screen. Above his head, one of the Shared Facility’s drop ships stood on extended legs, a squat lifting-body shape, hold doors open. To one side, the main hangar’s transparent dome showed a vast darkness, fitfully illuminated by long lighting flashes like sheets of tipped diamond catching the light of a dim blue sun.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Checking for scrits, Hervil?’ Fassin asked, approaching by bounce along the fused-rock floor.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Apsile grinned at the sound of Fassin’s voice but watched the hand-held’s screen until he’d got to the end of the seam he was inspecting. He switched the machine off and turned to Fassin. ‘Just the standard varieties detected so far, Seer Taak.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Scrits were the almost certainly mythical creatures which Dwellers blamed when anything went badly wrong anywhere in their vicinity. The humans who had lately taken up the baton of Dweller Studies had adopted early on the idea of scrits to account for the high degree of malfunctions any interaction with - or indeed near - the Dwellers seemed to involve. It was either that or accept that the Dwellers’ endemic technological carelessness and congenital lack of enthusiasm for keeping machinery in reliably working order was somehow contagious.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin patted the dark flank of the fat, arrowhead-shaped gascraft. This was his own machine, designed specifically for and partly by Fassin himself. It was about five metres long, four across the beam if you included the outboard manoeuvring nacelles and a little under two metres in height. Its smooth form was broken only by the shut lines of its various manipulators and manoeuvring impellers, a few sensor bulges, and the rear power assembly, vanes currently stowed. Fassin rubbed his hand over its port tail fin. ‘All prepped and ready, Herv?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Entirely,’ Apsile said. He was Nubianly black, slim but muscled, sleekly bald. Only a few lines round his eyes made him look remotely as old as he was, which was very. Every year or so, before his annual depilatory treatment - he thought gene treatment too invasive - a white micro-stubble would start to appear on his scalp, giving his head the appearance of a bristling star field. ‘And you?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, prepped and ready too,’ Fassin told him. He’d just come from the day’s final briefing, with the Dweller Current State people. It was their challenging brief to try and keep abreast of what was going on in the sheer and utter chaos that was Dweller society and, as a sideline, keep track of where the major Dweller structures, institutions and - especially - Individuals Of Interest were at any given moment.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The news was not good: a formal war was brewing between Zone two and Belt C, at least one long-term storm structure between Zone one and Belt D was collapsing while two were building elsewhere, and the movements of IOIs recently had been particularly fluid. One might even say capricious. As for the whereabouts of choal Valseir, well. Nobody had seen anything of the fellow for centuries.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Dwellers had always been hard to follow. In the past people had tried setting drone remotes on individuals to keep tabs on them. However, Dwellers regarded this as a gross intrusion on their privacy and had an uncanny ability to spot and destroy any such platforms, micro-gascraft or bugs, no matter how small or clever they were. Dwellers also sulked. When people had the temerity to try anything so underhand, cooperation was withdrawn. Sometimes over an entire population. Sometimes for years.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Slow Seers of Nasqueron had a pretty good relationship with the local Dwellers. By Dweller Studies standards it was almost close, but only because the Seers tried to interfere as little as possible with Dweller life. In return the Dwellers were relatively cooperative, and broadcast a daily update on the location of their most important cities, structures and institutions. This eight-and-a-bit-hourly bulletin was a byword for trustworthiness - almost a legend - in Dweller Studies, on occasion approaching accuracy rates of very nearly ninety per cent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Things fine with Sept Bantrabal?’ Apsile asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All well. Slovius sends his regards.’ Fassin had talked to his uncle a few hours earlier, still trying to persuade him to leave the Autumn House. The time delay between Third Fury and ’glantine made a normal conversation just about possible. He’d caught up with Jaal too, on the other side of ’glantine, at her Sept’s Spring House. Life appeared relatively normal back on ’glantine, the new Emergency affecting people there less than it seemed to on Sepekte.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Apsile flicked a roll-screen from his sleeve and tapped a few patches. He looked casually up at the lifter ship poised above the little gascraft, ready to accept the smaller vessel inside its open hold and take it down to the gas-giant’s atmosphere. Fassin followed the Master Technician’s gaze. He looked at a dark shape already hanging inside the cargo space, protruding downwards from it like a thick wheel. He frowned. ‘That looks a lot like Colonel Hatherence,’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not many places she’ll fit,’ muttered Apsile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eh?’ A voice bellowed. Then, quieter: ‘My name? Oh. Yes, that’s me. Seer Taak. Major Taak, I should say. Hello. Sorry; asleep. Well, you know, one does. Thought I’d try out this space here for size. Fits very well, must say. I shall be able to be transported to the atmosphere of Nasqueron most ably by this vessel, if needs be. Well, so I think. Think you so too, Master Technician?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Apsile smiled broadly, revealing teeth as jet as his skin. ‘I think so too, ma’am.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There we are agreed, then.’ The giant hanging discus dropped fractionally from its mountings inside the delta-shaped transporter, so that it could turn and twist towards them. ‘And so. Major Taak. How goes your attempt to persuade Chief Seer Braam Ganscerel that you ought to be allowed to delve directly?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin smiled. ‘It goes like a long-term delve, colonel; exceeding slow.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A pity!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Apsile thumbed a patch on his roll-screen, clicked the screen back into his sleeve and nodded at the little gascraft. ‘Well, she’s ready. Want to put her up?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why not?’ It had become something of a tradition that Apsile and Fassin lifted the craft into the carrier. They stooped, took an end each and - very slowly at first - hoisted the arrowhead into the space above, letting their feet lift off the floor at the end to slow it down. The gascraft weighed next to nothing in Third Fury’s minuscule gravity, but it massed over two tonnes and the laws regarding inertia and momentum still applied. They were carried three metres up inside the drop ship’s hold, towards the opened arms of the waiting gascraft cradle. The Colonel’s esuit took up the space of two of the little gascraft, but that still left room for another five in the drop ship’s hold. The arrowhead snicked into place alongside the tall discus that held Colonel Hatherence. Satisfied that the arrowhead was correctly fastened in, the two men let themselves fall back to the floor. The colonel drifted down alongside them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up at the sleek lines of the gascraft. <span class="italic">How small it looks</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Tiny space to spend years in . . . decades in . . . even centuries</span> . . . They landed. Apsile, more experienced, got his knee-flex just right; Fassin bounced.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The giant esuit had to tilt to clear the carrier ship’s opened hold doors, toppling then coming upright again with a burr of vanes and a whoosh of air. ‘I must say I myself would prefer to enter the atmosphere directly, that is to say, in fact. Indeed, in reality,’ the colonel shouted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ Fassin said. ‘I would too, colonel.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good luck in that!’ the oerileithe boomed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thank you,’ Fassin said. ‘I suspect good luck will be necessary, if not sufficient.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A few hours later he had just about enough time to reflect that it was bad luck which produced the opportunity they had both been looking for, before he had to flee for his life. The others persuaded him eventually. Thay, Sonj and Mome were all going. Why not him? Not nervous, surely? Maybe just too lazy?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He wasn’t nervous or - quite - that lazy. He just wanted to stay back at the nest and bland with K, who was coming to the end of a tream, socked into a traumalyser and a linked-up subsal. She floated, lightly tethered, in the gentle stream blowing out of the air chair, slim graceful body semi-foetal, arms waving, her long, end-tied chestnut hair blossoming above her like a cobra hood, wrapping over her head then wafting back again. The NMR net was like a hand with twenty-plus slim silver fingers grasping her head from the back. The subsal’s transparent tube disappeared into a tiny neuro-taplet just behind her left earlobe. K’s eyes moved languidly behind their lids and her face seemed set in a smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">At this stage, coming out of a long tream, it was as though she had been diving in some abyssal depths and was now swimming slowly back in through a few kilometres of sunlit shallows. You could wade out to meet the person coming in without surrendering yourself to the whole para-lucid chemical /NMR-holo-induced dream state, you could sort of snorkel with them while they still gilled, heading for the beach that was mundane reality.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hey, Fass! she’d sent when he first dipped in to join her, slipping on a small NMR collar and becoming part of the slowly evaporating tream. She’d been away for a day and a half; a long one. - You came to meet me? Thanks, part!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Have fun? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- More than fun. Guess where I’ve been?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He sent a shrug. - Faintest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I did a delve! I treamed a delve like Seers do, into Nasqueron! Well, it wasn’t really Nasq, it was another gas-giant called Furenasyle. That’s where the chip must have been templated. You heard of Furenasyle?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yeah, it’s another place they do Dweller Studies. So you treamed you were there? Delving, yeah?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Surely did. You make it sound so amazing. And, Fass, it was great! Best tream . . . well, second-best tream I’ve ever had! K sent a kind of complicit, sexy smirk in his direction. He guessed the tream she was referring to. They’d experienced it together. A love-tream, a joint immersion in what they felt for each other. Well, supposedly. Love treams were tacky in some ways - you could still lie about your feelings in them, and if you selected the right template from the traumalyser device and suitable accompanying chemicals from the subsal, you could pretty much guarantee a tream of surpassing, wide-eyed heart-throbbing bliss even between two people who basically hated each other. But it had been good, between the two of them. Good, but not something that he’d wanted to do again. He supposed he was suspicious of the whole Virtual Reality experience, and treaming, especially with a synched-in subsal providing appropriate synthesised chemicals for delivery to the brain, was the most immersive VR you could find. Legally or semi-legally, anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You should try it! Really! It would be like practice, don’t you think?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I suppose. If delving is what I’m going to end up doing. I take it you’d recommend it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- If it’s like that, sure!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sure was what he was not. He was still young, still undecided. Should he become a Slow Seer, like everybody seemed to expect him to become, even including the people he shared the nest with on Hab 4409 (‘The Happy Hab!’)? Or should he do something else entirely? He still didn’t know. The very fact that everybody thought he would become a Seer eventually, after a few wild years - and these were surely wild years, not something that you ever imagined could go on for ever or even for very long - made him all the more determined not to do what was expected of him . . . well, maybe ‘determined’ was too strong a word, he admitted. Reluctant. Made him more reluctant. He supposed that was better. Still, he might surprise them all. He might go off and do something entirely, utterly and excitingly different. He just had to experience lots of different things until he found the right thing, was all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Listen, I’m probably going with the others to the protest. Well, unless you need me, you know . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Good for you! I don’t mind. You go. I’d come too, but I need to ramp out of this shallow. That last time I steeped really crawled. Ugh!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Okay. See you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Later, part!</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He left the nest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The nest - a low-gee pod of forty or so mostly small spherical rooms housing a kind of commune of (all human) gappers, nopers, treamers, trustafarians, zealers and zonkers - was in a big bunch of living spaces up near the hab’s long axis, near the (rather arbitrarily termed) ‘west’ end, not far beneath the suntube. The nest allegedly belonged to the mother of one of the trustafarians, though unofficially it was the Immaturian People’s Republic of Whateverness (and had semi-official paperwork and software to prove it, too).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Hab 4409 was one of a few hundred thousand habitats orbiting Sepekte. It was average size, a cylinder of re-formed asteroid material fifty kilometres long and ten across, spinning to create about two-thirds of a gee at its internal diameter surface. It turned in the unending sunlight like a giant garden roller flattening photons. Two twelve-kilometre mirror-lens systems - one at either end - faced Ulubis star like a pair of vast, unbearably thin flowers. Further mirror complexes funnelled the captured sunlight through two windows of diamond sheet into the hab’s long axis, where a final set of mirrors - moving up and down the suntube to create something like the feel of a planetary day - finally directed the light towards the internal surface. Or at least finally directed the light towards the internal surface if there wasn’t something like one of the grape-bunch-like nest complexes in the way (more mirrors).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Many more people lived in the habs than lived on planets in the system and most of the habs were somewhere near Sepekte. Hab 4409 had been a fairly liberal, free-flowing, laissez-faire, who-cares kind of place almost since its inception - as part of a horrendously intricate incumbent species asset-swap write-off dodge - two millennia earlier. Even its ultimate ownership had never fully been settled, and several generations of lawyers had gone to their plush retirements - having followed the saga of Hab 4409’s provenance and title since their days as articled clerks - still lacking a sense of closure re the above.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So the place attracted drifters, artists, misfits, natural exiles, political and other eccentrics and slightly deranged or badly messed-up people of more or less every sort, and always had. Most were from Ulubis but some were more exotic and from further afield, generally trustafarians and/or gappers portaling in from the rest of the Mercatoria, taking time out between education and responsibility to relax a little. The place produced good art, it was an unofficial - but tax-deductible - finishing school for the aforesaid children of the rich (give the darling brats true freedom and let them see how empty it was, was the idea), it was a way station for those heading out to disgrace or back from perdition, and it was a halfway house for those who might or might not ever again contribute anything useful to society but who just might galvanise it fundamentally. (And, if you wanted to be really paranoid about stuff, it was - as far as the authorities were concerned - a relatively easy-to-watch and even easier-to-close-down sump for dangerous ideas: a radical trap.) It was useful, in other words. It fulfilled a purpose, if not several. In a society as large as that which existed around Ulubis, somewhere had to provide that sort of service.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">People were people. Some would always be straight, some would always be a bit twisted, but they all had some sort of part to play, and they were all in some sense valuable, were they not?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But now the fucking Mercatoria, the fucking Ascendancy or fucking Omnocracy, or whatever they fucking were, the fucking Hierchon (more likely, one of his new rotational crop of advisers who saw a way to make some money and gain some extra power), or the Peregal below him or Apparitor below <span class="italic">him</span> or just the Diegesian gimplet who was actually nominally the governor or mayor or whatever he was supposed to fucking be (his post, his presence and his protecting bully boys only here at all thanks to an earlier dispute over who controlled what, resulting in a grubby, century-old compromise), anyway the fucking big boys, the fucking people who owned fucking everything or thought <span class="italic">some</span> fucker ought to own fucking everything had decided, decreed, <span class="italic">deemed</span> that proprietorship of the whole fucking place - and that of lots of other similar habs in similar situations of disputed/uncertain/dubious/happily contingent ownership - should pass to what they called a properly accredited and responsible authority. Which basically meant them. Or if not them, their chums. Somebody who took things like ownership and rent-gathering and petty law-enforcement and so on seriously. It was the law-makers, the law-givers, being outlaws, and it would not be allowed to stand, it would not be allowed to pass, it would not go unchallenged, it would not go into the local statutes without a serious fucking challenge. These people, for whatever fuckwit reason, were destroying part of what was good about the habs, about Sepekte-Orbit, about Ulubis system, about the society they were all in the end a part of. Ultimately they were being stupid and self-destructive, and all that was required was that the people who could see all this clearly - because they were right here, at the sharp end, at the cutting edge - pointed this out to them. They were all on the same side in the end, it was just that sometimes the fuckers in authority got too far away from the reality of life as the mass of people lived it, and that was when you had to make a stand, make a point and make yourself heard.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So they went to the protest, down the friction tubes and the bungees and along the tramways to the central plaza and the makings of a great crowd.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You just have to think about it,’ Mome said as they walked the last street into the plaza. ‘The Beyonders never attack habs, never attack whole cities, never attack anything big and easy and defenceless. They attack the military and the authorities and big infrastructure stuff. Their attacks, their violence, their military strategy is a discourse amenable to analysis if one is prepared to approach it shorn of propagandistic preconceptions. And the message is clear: their argument, their war is with the Mercatorial system, with the Ascendancy and the Omnocracy and the Administrata and not with the common people, not with us.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Resent being called common!’ Sonj protested.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Erring on the side of generosity including you in the category “people”, Sonj,’ Mome shot back. Mome was a little guy, pale, intense and always slightly hunched, as though perpetually preparing either to pounce or duck. Sonj was huge; a big bumbling dark brown geezer of changeable moods and intensely curly short red hair who only looked at home or even slightly graceful in low gee.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Doesn’t necessarily make them the good guys,’ Fassin insisted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Makes them people open to reason, people capable of indulging in meaningful dialogue,’ Mome said. ‘Not just mad fuckers to be put down like vermin, which is pretty much what we’re told they are.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So what’s stopping them talking to us?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Us,’ Mome said. ‘Takes two to talk.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They all looked at him. Mome was known to talk a lot. Sometimes to audiences who had, basically, long since fallen asleep. He shrugged.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My cousin Lain—’ Thay said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Another</span> one?’ Mome asked, feigning incredulity.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sister of cousin Kel, half-sister of cousin Yayz,’ Thay explained patiently. She was Sonj’s part, also generously made; awkward in low gee but bouncily agile on the hab’s internal surface at two-thirds of a gee. ‘My cousin Lain,’ she continued determinedly, ‘the one in the Navarchy, says that she reckons the reason the Beyonders attack so much at all is because if they don’t the Navarchy and the Summed Fleet goes after them. And we don’t just attack military stuff. She says we hit their habs. Kill millions of them. Lot of offs unhappy with—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Lots of <span class="italic">whats</span> unhappy with?’ Mome asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Lots of offs,’ Thay repeated.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I got the <span class="italic">word</span>,’ Mome repeated with a sigh, ‘I just didn’t get the <span class="italic">meaning</span>.’ He snapped his fingers. ‘Wait. Short for “officers”, right?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Correct.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Brilliant. Carry on.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Lot of offs unhappy with this,’ Thay said again, ‘so the ’yonds - the Beyonders - just attack us to keep us on the defensive.’ She nodded once. ‘That’s what my cousin Lain says.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ayee! Crazy ’yonding talk,’ Mome said, putting his hands over his ears. ‘Get us all arrested.’ They laughed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘At least we have the freedom to say this sort of thing,’ Fassin pointed out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Mome did his special Hollow Laugh.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>In the central plaza, Fassin greeted people, drank in the sense of solidarity and slightly edgy fun - lots of inventive costumes, towering floss-sculptures and buzzing balloonderers (trailing slogan banners, yelling chants and scattering narconfetti) - but still felt oddly apart from it all. He looked up and around, ignoring for the moment the people - mostly human - and the circle of domed and gleaming buildings.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The hab was a giant, verdant city rolled up into a spinning tube, with small hills and many lakes and criss-cross avenues between low-rise hanging-garden apartments and winding rivers and spindly towers, some arched like bows and reaching all the way up to the suntube, where they curved - or needle-eyed - round to meet towers on the far side. Bunches of nests - surrounded by mirrors, trailed with friction tubes like jungle creepers - clustered near the long axis, and dirigiblisters floated like strange, semi-transparent clouds beneath them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then Fassin heard some sort of shout at one edge of the crowd, nearest the palace of the Diegesian, which was the focus for the protest. He might have smelled something strange, but then that was probably just one of the cruising balloonderers disseminating some drug that Fassin’s immedio-immune system hadn’t recognised. Then he realised maybe it wasn’t, because all the balloonderers dropped suddenly, as one, out of the air. Also, the sun in the suntube went out. Which never happened. He heard lots of odd noises, some of which might have been screaming. It seemed to get cold very quickly. That was odd too. People were hitting him, with their shoulders mostly, as they went running past him, then they were falling over him, and he realised he was <span class="italic">Fassin?</span>, realised he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span> lying down, then he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span> getting hit again, but he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span> trying to get up and stand again, and he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span>, he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span>, he was on his knees and he was <span class="italic">Fassin</span> just about to get up from his knees onto his feet - swaying, feeling very strange, wondering what all the people were doing lying down around him - when - <span class="italic">Fassin</span> - he was knocked down again. By a man in armour, steel grey, with a big trunchbuster club and no face and a couple of little buzz-drones at each shoulder, spraying gas and making a high, terrible keening noise that he - <span class="italic">Fassin!</span> - wanted to get away from, but his nose and eyes and everything else stung and hurt and he didn’t know what to do, he was <span class="italic">Fasssin!</span> just standing there and the guy with the big club thing as long as a spear came up to him and he <span class="italic">Fasssin?</span> stupidly thought he might ask him what was going on and what was wrong with <span class="italic">Faaassssiiinnn?</span> wrong when the man swept his club-spear trunchbuster thing round and into his face, knocking some teeth out and sending him spinning to</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Fassin?</span>’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His name finally jolted him awake.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Back with us? Good.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The speaker was a small man in a large chair across a cramped-looking metal desk. The room - or whatever - was too dark to see into, even with IR. The sound of the man’s voice in the space suggested it was not a big space. Fassin was aware that his face and especially his mouth hurt. He tried to wipe his mouth. He looked down. His hands could not move because his forearms were - he tried to think of the right word - shackled? They were shackled to the seat he was sitting in. What the hell was this? He started laughing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Somebody hit him in his bones. It was like his entire skeleton was a wind chime and his flesh and muscles and organs were somewhere else, only nearby but still connected somehow and some fucker - actually, some very large group of fuckers - had taken a whole load of hammers and whacked each one of his bones really hard at the same time. The pain went almost as quickly as it arrived, leaving just a weird sort of echo in his nerves.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What the fuck was zhat?’ he asked the little man. His voice sounded comical with some of his teeth knocked out. His tongue probed the gaps. Felt like two out, one loose. He tried to remember how long it took adult teeth to grow back. The little man was quite a jolly-looking soul, with a plump, amused-seeming face and chubby, rosy cheeks. His hair was black, cropped. He wore a uniform of a type that Fassin didn’t recognise. ‘Are you shucking <span class="italic">torturing</span> me?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No,’ the little man said in a very reasonable tone of voice. ‘I’m just doing this to get your attention.’ One of his hands moved on the desk’s surface.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin’s bones clattered as though played upon again. His nerves, having experienced this twice now, decided that really this was no joke, and in fact felt extremely sore.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘All right! All right!’ he heard himself saying. ‘I take the shucking point. Fucking point,’ he said, working out how to adapt his pronunciation to his new dental layout.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Don’t swear,’ the little man said, and hurt him again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Okay!’ he screamed. His head hung. Snot dripped from his nose, saliva and blood from his mouth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Please don’t swear,’ the little man said. ‘It indicates an untidy mind.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just tell me what the f—what you want,’ Fassin said. Was this real? Had he been in some sort of weird VR dream ever since he’d joined K for the coming-out-of-the-shallows end-of-tream thing earlier? Was this what happened when you got tream templates cheap, or illegally copied or something? Was this real? It felt painful enough to be real. He looked down at his legs and the hems of his shorts, all covered in blood and mucus and snot. He could see individual hairs on his legs, some standing, some plastered to his skin. He could see pores. Didn’t that mean it was real? But of course it didn’t. Treams, simcasts, VR, all depended on the fact that the mind could really only concentrate on one thing at a time. The rest was illusion. Human sight, the most complicated sense the species possessed, had been doing that for millions of years, fooling the mind behind the eyes. You thought you had colour vision, and in some detail, over this wide angle but really you didn’t; accurate colour vision was concentrated within a tiny part of the visual field, with only vague, movement-wary black-and-white awareness extending over the rest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The brain played tricks on itself to pretend that it saw as well away from the centre of its visual target as it did right at that bull’s-eye. Smart VR used that same deception; zoom in on a detail and it would be created for you in all its pinpoint exactitude, but everything else you weren’t attending to with such concentration could safely be ignored until your attention swung that way, keeping the amount of processing power within acceptable limits.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin dragged his attention away from his blood-spattered leg. ‘Is this real?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man sighed. ‘Mr Taak,’ he said, glancing down at a screen, ‘your profile indicates that you are from a respectable family and may one day even become a useful member of society. You shouldn’t be mixing and living with the sort of people you have been mixing and living with. You’ve all been very foolish and people have suffered because of that stupidity. You’ve been living in a kind of dream, really, and that dream is now over. Officially. I think you ought to go back home. Don’t you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Where are my friends?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mr Iifilde, Mr Resiptiss, Ms Cargin and Ms Hohuel?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin just stared at him. Shit, in all the last few months he’d been staying here he’d only known them by their first names. He supposed those were Thay, Sonj and Mome’s last names, but really he’d no idea. And there had been four, hadn’t there? Did that mean they were counting K as well? But she hadn’t been to the protest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They’re being held elsewhere, or they’ve been processed and released, or we’re still looking for them.’ The little man smiled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked down at his arms, held within metal hoops. He tried to move his legs, then leaned over and looked down. His legs were shackled too. Or manacled or whatever. His mouth felt very odd. He ran his tongue round where where his teeth had been, checking again. He supposed he’d have to get false ones until the new ones grew back. Or sport a piratical grin. ‘Why am I being treated like this?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man looked incredulous. He appeared to be about to hurt Fassin again, then shook his head in exasperation. ‘Because you took part in a violent demonstration against the Diegesian, that’s why!’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But I wasn’t violent,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You personally may not have been. The demonstration you took part in most certainly was.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin would have scratched his head. ‘Is that all it takes?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who started the violence?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man jerked his arms out to each side. His voice went very high. ‘Does it <span class="italic">matter</span>?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had meant which side, but he could tell the little man thought he’d meant which demonstrator. He sighed. ‘Look, I just want to get back to my friends, to my nest. Can I go? I didn’t do anything, I got my teeth knocked out, I can’t tell you anything, or . . . anything . . .’ he said. He sighed again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You can go when you sign this.’ The little man swivelled the screen around so Fassin could see. He looked at what he was supposed to sign, and at the fingerprint pad and camera patches on the screen which would record that it had really been him signing (or, more to the point, make a fake document take up a fraction more storage space).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I can’t sign this,’ he said. ‘It basically says my friends are all Beyonder agents and deserve death.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man rolled his eyes. ‘Read it <span class="italic">carefully</span>, will you? It just says you have <span class="italic">suspicions</span> in that regard. You don’t seriously think <span class="italic">your</span> word would be enough to convict anybody of anything, do you?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well then, why get me to—?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We want you to <span class="italic">betray</span> them!’ the little man shouted, as though it was the most obvious thing ever. ‘We want you to turn your back on them and become a productive member of society. That’s all.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But they’re my friends.’ Fassin coughed, swallowed. ‘Look, could I get a drink of water?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No. You can’t. And they’re not your friends. They’re just people you know. They’re barely acquaintances. You got drunk with them, got stoned with them, talked a bit with them and slept with some of them. You’ll all go your separate ways soon enough anyway and probably never keep in touch. They are not your friends. Accept that.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought better of debating what being a friend meant, in the circumstances. ‘Well, I’m still not betraying them.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They’ve betrayed you!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little interrogator swung the screen round, clicked on a few patches and swung it back. Fassin watched Thay, Sonj and Mome - all stuck in seats like the one he was secured in, and Sonj looking pretty beaten-up - say they thought that Fassin held Beyonder sympathies and was a danger to society who needed watching. They each mumbled something to that effect, signed the screen and pressed a thumb against the print patch (Sonj’s left a smear of blood).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screenage shook him. It had probably been faked, but all the same. He sat back. ‘You faked that,’ he said, unsteadily.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man laughed. ‘Are you mad? Why would we bother?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t know,’ Fass admitted. ‘But I know my friends. They wouldn’t—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man sat forward. ‘So just sign this and in the <span class="italic">highly</span> unlikely event that it ever crops up, just say <span class="italic">yours</span> has been faked.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So why not fake it anyway?’ Fassin shouted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Because then you won’t have <span class="italic">betrayed</span> them!’ the little man yelled back. ‘Come on! Sign and you can go. I’ve got better things to do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But why do any of this?’ Fassin said, wanting to cry. ‘Why make anybody betray anybody?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man looked at him for a moment. ‘Mr Taak,’ he said, sitting back, sounding patient. ‘I’ve inspected your profile. You are not stupid. Misguided, idealistic, naive, certainly, but not stupid. You must know how societies work. You must at least have an inkling. They work on force, power and coercion. People don’t behave themselves because they’re nice. That’s the liberal fallacy. People behave themselves because if they don’t they’ll be punished. All this is known. It isn’t even debatable. Civilisation after civilisation, society after society, species after species, all show the same pattern. Society is control: control is reward and punishment. Reward is being allowed to partake of the fruits of that society and, as a general but not unbreakable rule, not being punished without cause.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘But—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Be quiet. The idiotic issue you chose to complain about - ownership of a habitat - really has nothing to do with you. It’s a legal matter, an ownership thing. You weren’t even born here and you wouldn’t have stayed beyond a few more months anyway, admit it. You should have kept out of it. You chose not to, you put yourself in harm’s way and now you’re paying the price. Part of that price is letting us know that you have made an effort to dissociate yourself from the people you were complicit with. Once you do that, you can go. Home, I would suggest. I mean to ’glantine.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And if I say no?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You mean not sign?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seriously?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seriously.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then it’s taken out of my hands. You’ll go to meet people who enjoy doing this sort of thing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This time, when the little man moved his hand over the desk, Fassin screamed with the pain. He must have bitten his tongue. There was a taste of iron and his mouth filled with fresh blood and hot saliva.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Because I,’ the little man said wearily, ‘don’t.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>In the end Fassin signed. He’d kind of known he would.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little man looked happy, and a couple of big female guards came in and helped Fassin from the chair, his bonds unfastened.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thank you, Mr Taak,’ the little man said, and grasped his hand and shook it before they took him out of the room. ‘I hate all that unpleasantness, and it is always so good to see somebody being sensible. Try not to think too badly of me. Good luck to you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They got him showered down and fixed up and he left after a medical and a cup of soup, dressed in paper-thin overalls. He looked around when they ushered him through the doorways into what passed for outside in a hab. He’d been somewhere inside the Diegesian’s palace.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Back at the nest, turmoil. The place had been raided, trashed, everything in it broken or sprayed with stinking, vomit-inducing crowd-control goo. They went to a bar instead and didn’t really talk about anything after the protest and the crackdown. They talked instead of rumours of people being killed and others disappearing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">K wasn’t there. She’d been beaten up when the troopers came to turn the nest over. She was in a prison hospital ship for three weeks, then killed herself with a broken glass the day she was released.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>It was months before Fassin learned the truth. K had been sent into a nightmare tream. Somebody who’d come with the law officers - maybe just one of them who happened to know how to handle tream gear - had found her still floating, not yet out of the delving tream, and altered the settings on the traumalyser and the subsal while some others had held her down and worked her over. Whoever did the thing with the traumalyser must have carried that sort of template chip around with them, just for such eventualities. Then they’d left her, bloody and bound, to some speeded-up nightmare of horror, rape and torture.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were all split up, doing other, mostly more responsible things when they pieced all this together. They talked about a complaint, an investigation, a protest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin went back to ’glantine and booked a place on the Seer induction course for the term after next. Then he returned to the habs, and then to Sepekte’s Boogeytown, to the roaring life, the drink and drugs and fucking and fun, and - after a while, gradually, carefully - made a few inquiries, hung out in the right places, and met certain people. Apparently he passed a few tests without realising he’d been taking them, and then one night he was introduced to a girl who called herself Aun Liss.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Fassin!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His name jolted him awake. Third Fury; cabin. Still night-dark. Clanging noise. The screen showed hour Four. The screen was red and flashing. Had somebody spoken?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What?’ he said, tearing the restraints away and levering himself out of bed, floating towards the centre of the cabin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Herv Apsile,’ said a voice. Sounded like Apsile. Sounded like Apsile in a state of some excitement or distress. ‘We have a situation. Looks like an attack.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Oh, shit</span>. Fassin pulled on clothes, called up full lights. ‘That fucking horrendous clanging noise the alarm?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You in Facility Command?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who do we think?’ A light flashed over a storage locker and it revolved, revealing an emergency esuit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Don’t know. Two naval units vaporised already. Get suited and—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The lights - all the lights - flickered. The screen did not come back on. A tremor made the cabin shake. Something broke in the bathroom with a sharp crack.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You feel that? You still there?’ Apsile said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes to both,’ Fassin said. He was looking at the esuit.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Suit up and take a drop shaft to the emergency shelter.’ Apsile paused. ‘You got that?’ Another pause. ‘Fass?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Here.’ Fassin started pulling all his clothes off again. ‘That what you’re going to do, Herv?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s what we’re both supposed to do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another tremble made the whole cabin rattle. The air seemed to quake like jelly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The alarm shut off. Somehow, though, not in an encouraging way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The screen flashed once, screeched.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin hauled the esuit out of its locker. ‘How’s the main hangar?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Intact. Whatever’s hitting us seems to be coming in from the Nasq spin-side, slightly retro.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So heading into the centre’s going to be putting us closer,’ Fassin said. Was that a draught? He could hear a hissing sound. He clipped the esuit collar round his neck and let the gel helmet deploy. It turned everything hazy and quiet for a moment, then decided the situation wasn’t too dire yet, and opened slits for him to breathe, talk and hear through. The face-mask section thinned to near-perfect transparency.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘For now,’ Apsile agreed. ‘If the direction of the hostile fire stays constant we’ll be coming round to face it full on in two hours.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin stepped into the esuit and pulled it up, letting it connect with the collar, adjusting to his body, huffing and settling. Very comfortable, really. ‘That what you want to do, Herv? Sit in a huddle with everybody else like mice in a hole hoping the cat goes away?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Standing orders.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know. Want to guess what I want to do?’ There was a pause. Another more violent tremor shook the cabin. The main door popped open, wobbling inwards, revealing the companionway outside. The pause went on. ‘Herv?’ he asked. He looked round for anything he might want to take with him. Nothing. ‘Herv?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’ll see you there.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Something blazed hard and blue-white against Nasqueron’s side-lit face, turning the hangar into a harsh jagged jumble of fiercely shining surfaces and intensely black shadows. Fassin flinched. The light faded quickly, turning to yellow and orange; a small fading sun shone between the moon and Nasqueron.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Herv Apsile had got there ahead of him. He gave a quick wave and easily jumped the eight metres to the open nose-blister of the carrier craft, disappearing inside. The nose-blister closed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Herv?’ Fassin said, trying the suit’s emergency comms. No answer. He made slow bounds for the open hold. Colonel Hatherence was already there, the tall discus of her esuit floating a fraction above the floor directly beneath the place she’d filled earlier.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seer Taak! I rather thought you might adopt this course!’ she shouted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Shit</span>, Fassin thought. He’d kind of hoped the colonel would have made her way to the emergency shelter in the moon’s core, ten kilometres down, along with everybody else, like they’d all been told to. There was one drop shaft big enough, wasn’t there? Oh well. He came to a stop beneath the little arrowhead gascraft hanging in its cradle directly above. ‘Colonel,’ he said, nodding.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Would she try to stop him? No idea. Could she? No doubt about that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not sure whether to be relieved or terrified,’ the colonel yelled. A manipulator arm creased out from the side of the oerileithe esuit, unfolding towards Fassin. <span class="italic">Oh, fuck</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Here we go</span>.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘After you!’ the colonel said, her arm indicating the space above.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin smiled and jumped. She rose with a whirr beside him. Stopped and then braced by the ceiling of the hold, he flipped open the cockpit of the little gascraft, revealing a vaguely coffin-shaped space. He shucked the suit and unclipped the helmet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Out of uniform, major,’ the colonel said jovially, voice echoing in the enclosed space of the upper hold. Fassin let the suit fall slowly to the floor beneath and stepped into the foot of the little arrowhead’s cockpit. ‘Gracious!’ Hatherence said. ‘Are all human males of this form?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just the handsome ones, colonel,’ he assured her. He lowered himself carefully into the cool gel. The cockpit cover closed over him. He wriggled in the darkness, getting his neck positioned over the scanner collar. A soft light and a gentle chime confirmed all was well. He reached for the double nozzle of the gillfluid root, took a deep breath, let it out, then placed the nozzles at his nostrils.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin lay back, zoning out as best he could, fighting the urge to panic, the gag response of fear as the gillfluid poured into his nose, throat and lungs like the coldest drink anybody had ever taken.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A moment of confusion, disorientation. Then the collar nestling closer against his neck and the warming gel closing over his body, tendrils seeking out ears, mouth, penis and anus. Twin stings of pain on his forearms, then another pair, one under each ear, as the blood slides went in.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Set?’ said the voice of Herv Apsile, gurgling through the still calibrating gel in his ears.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Thoroughly, he sent back just by thinking. - And the colonel?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I am set, also!’ Even over comms, it seemed, Colonel Hatherence tended to shout.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had been wondering if they could leave her behind somehow. Probably not, then.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hold doors closing. Ready to go,’ Apsile said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin started to become his little gascraft. It covered him, embraced him, multiply penetrated him, and in those acts offered itself up to him completely. The light from below disappeared as the hold doors closed. He could see Colonel Hatherence’s esuit hanging beside him, sense its cold and read its electromagnetic signature, just as he could feel the systems of the drop ship readying, flexing, preparing, changing as the ship nudged itself off the floor. Other senses registered an unusual wash of radiations, a faint gravity well set in a much greater, deeper one, a slather of meaningless comms shards, confused transmissions and EM signals from the Shared Facility base itself - and a sudden jolt, a transmitted faint but massive thud followed by a strange sideways, upwards-sucking movement.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He waited for Apsile to talk to them, meanwhile trying to work it out himself. Distant whirr and hiss of the carrier tanking the air in its hold.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sorry about that,’ Apsile said mildly. ‘Back in control. Unconventional method of opening the hangar to vacuum there. No idea who to thank.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- We okay? Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘NSD,’ Apsile said, sounding mildly distracted. ‘No Significant Damage.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Let you get on with it, Fassin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thanks.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Cancel relief, emphasise terror,’ the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin hoped she was talking only to him. He checked through all the little gascraft’s settings and systems, settling into it as its life-support tendrils settled into him. Something like a wide array of lights seen from the bottom corner of the eye swung into focus in front of him. He called up a few read-outs and started a couple of subroutines to check that everything was working. Seemed to be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He felt the carrier accelerate away from the moon. Patch-through to the larger ship’s senses suddenly appeared as an option on his controls and he took it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Now he could experience pretty much what Apsile could.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nasqueron filling the sky ahead and up, the grey-brown surface of Third Fury disappearing fast below and behind. Debris clouds. Comms shards. More than there ought to be in a properly organised fleetlet like the one that had brought them here and that had been guarding the moon. No sign of illuminating radar or other targeting give-away. Not that a civilian ship like the carrier would be able to spot any but the most glaringly obvious. No current damage flags, just records of a few small hull impacts, little more than pitting. Ship drive traces. A sudden flare of radiation as a ship turned hard a couple of hundred klicks away, dying away. Outgoing signal loop, broadcasting their unarmed condition, claiming lifeboat status. Flash! From right behind. A near-semicircular debris cloud rising glittering from a new glowing crater maybe half a klick across on the surface of Third Fury. Three smaller craters coming into view, recent but cooled down to orange and red heat. The view twisted, overlays of lines and grids and drive symbols flickering into being.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Apsile pointed the carrier’s nose straight at Nasqueron and started a long, purposefully irregular corkscrew towards the gas-giant, accelerating the drop ship as hard as its engines would allow.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The drop ship was no sort of high-performance military unit; all it was supposed to do was take the gascraft from the Facility to the gas-giant and pick them up later. It was rugged, able to take the strain of operating inside Nasqueron’s gravity well and its various pressure environments down to the liquid-hydrogen level, and it had the power to lift itself and its charges easily enough out of Nasqueron’s grip. But it was not especially manoeuvrable, carried no armament or defensive systems and far from being stealthed had been designed from its invitation-to-tender spec. onwards to be as easy to see with as many different senses as it was possible to imagine, just so that no mischievous Dweller could crash something into it and then claim, sorry, they hadn’t seen it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How you doing down there?’ Apsile asked. He sounded in control, unworried.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fine, for myself,’ the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ditto, Fassin sent. - Got an ETA yet?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Trips from Third Fury to Nasq. usually took about an hour. Fassin hoped they could do it in less than half that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘With the main drive maxed we should make turnaround in about ten minutes,’ Apsile said, ‘then decelerate for another ten and then take . . . hmm, another handful - five at most, I’d hope - to get deep enough into the atmosphere.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He meant deep enough into the atmosphere to be beyond any but the most scary weapons. Obviously not counting the scary weapons the Dwellers possessed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Anything we can clip off that? Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Maybe we could make it down in less time once we hit the cloud tops,’ Apsile said. ‘Steeper, carrying more speed. Maybe. Hmm.’ Fassin got the impression somehow that the man was rubbing his chin. ‘Yes, maybe, if we let the heat and stress levels creep just a tad beyond tolerance.’ A pause. ‘Though of course that’s always assuming that the ship didn’t take any damage we don’t know about when the hangar dome got blown.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Always assuming, Fassin agreed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Master Technician,’ Colonel Hatherence said, ‘are we being pursued or under unit-specific attack?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No, colonel.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Then I suggest we adopt your first entry profile.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Decision’s yours alone, Herv, Fassin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Copy.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Can you access any military comms traffic, Master Technician?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m afraid not, ma’am, not unless they choose to target us with a clear beam or broadcast.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That is unfortunate. What seems to be happening?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Looks like there’s been some sort of firefight. Still going on, possibly. Drives spreading away from the moon, heading in the direction the hostile munitions appeared to be coming from. Woh!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The flash attracted Fassin’s second-hand attention as well; another, even larger crater glowing white on the surface of Third Fury.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What of the people still back within the Third Fury moonlet? ’ the colonel asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Been listening,’ Apsile said. ‘I’ll try and contact them direct. Give me a moment.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Silence. Fassin watched space wheel around them through the carrier ship’s sensors. He checked the drop ship’s system profile, oriented, then searched for and found ’glantine; a tiny shining dot, far away. The sensors let him zoom in until the planet moon was a shining gibbous image, scintillating with magnification artefacts, hints of its topography just about visible. Could that be the uplands? There, that light patch - the Sea of Fines? A spark. There, back up . . . A tiny flash? Had he seen that?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something colder and more invasive than any gel tendril seemed to invade him, clutching at his stomach and heart. No, surely not. Just another artefact of the system. He looked for the sensor-replay controls.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shit, there’s a fucking wreckage—’ Apsile said, then the craft bucked and swung. Fassin, turning his focus of attention back to what Apsile was looking at saw it too now: a field of dark specks across the face of the planet ahead of them like a ragged flock of birds far in the distance. They were at near-maximum velocity. The carrier started to turn.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A rush of dark scraps, tearing by on all sides like a thin shell of soot-black snow flakes. Fassin felt his arms, held by the cloying shock-gel, attempt to draw themselves in towards his body, instinctively trying to make himself a smaller target. Then they were through. No impacts.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After a moment, Fassin felt the drop ship start to swing round to present its drive tubes towards the planet, ready to begin deceleration. ‘I think,’ Apsile said cautiously, ‘that we just about got away with—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something slammed into them. The ship lurched - there was a concussive <span class="italic">snap!</span> that Fassin felt through the carrier ship, through the gascraft, even through the shock-gel. He lost the patch-through connection with the drop ship. He was back in his own little arrowhead again. They were whirling. And there was light, synched with the whirling. Light?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was coming from below, where the hold doors were. He could see Colonel H’s esuit, hanging alongside him. <span class="italic">Oh-oh . . .</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ship began to come out of the spin, steadying. The light from below faded but did not go away. It had the spectrum to be light reflected from Nasqueron. Light from the gas-giant coming in through supposedly closed doors. Fassin flipped the gascraft’s sensor ring to look straight down at the doors.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh fuck,’ he tried to say. There was a small but ragged hole, stuff hanging like spilled guts. The Nasqueron light was reflecting in off some polished-looking surfaces.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Force, building; very like the main drive decelerating them more or less on schedule. He retried the intercom, then broadcast a radio signal. - Herv?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Here. Sorry about that. Hit something after all. Got her straight and rearward. Back on track. No read-outs from the hold at all, though. Including the door.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Think that’s where it hit. I can see a hole.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How big?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Maybe a metre lateral by two.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I too can see the hole,’ the colonel told them, also joining in the radio-broadcast fun. ‘It is as Seer Taak describes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Too small for you guys to get out of,’ Apsile said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- How’s the rest of the ship? Fassin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Holding together for now. Can’t see where whatever hit us exited, or just went on to hit inside.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I suspect it hit me,’ Hatherence said. ‘My esuit casing, that is to say. Probably.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A pause. Then Apsile said, ‘And . . . are you all right?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Perfectly fine. Your hold doors took most of the energy out of it and my esuit is of exceptional quality, durability and damage-tolerance. Scarcely a scratch.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- If we can’t open the doors, we can’t get out and the whole thing’s pointless, Herv, Fassin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We can still hide in the carrier, under the clouds,’ Apsile said. ‘I’m not getting much from the Facility. That last hit looked like it must have shaken them pretty hard. We might still be safer under the gas than hanging around out here in clear view of whoever.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nothing comprehensible was coming out of the Shared Facility on Third Fury, and no military vessels were talking on civilian frequencies. Interference on EM bands, a problem at the best of times anywhere near Nasqueron, was especially intense. Apsile raised a couple of the Facility’s equatorial relay satellites, but, exceptionally, could not through-patch via their transceivers and could get only static and meaningless rubbish out of them. He even tried some Dweller mirror sats, where the surprise would have been getting anything other than drivel, but there the service was perfectly normal. ‘Ouch,’ they heard him say. ‘Third Fury just took another hit. We’re going in. Fairly slowly, to allow for the damage, but we’re going in.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Whatever you think is best, Master Technician,’ the colonel said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The carrier craft began to shudder as it met the upper atmosphere of Nasqueron, carving a glowing trail above the cloud tops. They slowed. Weight began to return to them. And kept on increasing. Creaks and ticking sounds came through the solids joining them to the drop ship. The buffeting decreased, grew and fell away again; soft whumps and crisp bangs also communicated through the drop ship’s structure announced debris being torn off the ragged surrounds of the breach in the hold doors, which glowed and sparked as the space around them filled with gas and Fassin began to detect sound in the hold again. They were getting heavy, really heavy now. Fassin could feel the shock-gel tightening around him, <span class="italic">like the sound of snow cramping beneath your feet</span>. He could almost sense any remaining gas bubbles in his body pancaking like blood cells. <span class="italic">Good and heavy now . . .</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Master Technician,’ the colonel said suddenly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hold on,’ Apsile said. ‘That—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The whole ship shook once, then rolled suddenly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Herv? Fassin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Got some sort of targeting—’ Apsile began, then broke off as the craft shook again and slewed wildly across the sky.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are indeed being targeted by something,’ Hatherence announced. ‘Master Technician,’ she shouted across the frequencies. ‘Are you yet able to release us?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eh? What? No! I—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Master Technician, attempt to perform a roll or part of an internal loop on my command,’ Hatherence told him. ‘I shall release us.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">You</span> will?’ Apsile shouted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I shall. I will. I carry weapons. Now, excuse me, and good luck.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Wait a minute, Fassin began.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Seer Taak,’ the colonel said tersely, ‘shield your senses.’ The big discus hanging beside him sent a pulse of blinding blue-white light straight downward at the doors, which blew away in a brief gout of sparks. Rushing yellow-brown clouds spun by outside. Fassin’s little arrowcraft was seeing spots. It got busy shuffling its damaged sensors round for working ones. He guessed he hadn’t shielded his senses in time. He shut them down now. ‘Releasing in three seconds,’ the colonel said. ‘Make your manoeuvre now if you please, Master Technician.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A blast of radiation and a spike of heat from above coincided with a sudden roll. The cradle holding Fassin in the drop ship gave way, sending him shooting from the hold like a cannon ball. The colonel in her oerileithe esuit came whirling after him a moment later, quickly drawing level. He glimpsed the drop ship above, still rolling, then saw a violet ray appear suddenly to one side, slicing through the gas around them, searing his barely mended vision. The beam just missed the carrier craft, then clouds of yellow fog rolled quickly up between them and the drop ship and it was just him and the colonel, a tiny arrow shape and a spinning coin of dirty grey, hurtling down into the vast chaotic skies of Nasqueron.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘“It is a given amongst those who care to study such matters that there is, within certain species, a distinct class of being so contemptuous and suspicious of their fellow creats that they court only hatred and fear, counting these the most sincere emotional reactions they may hope to excite, because they are unlikely to have been feigned.”’ The Archimandrite Luseferous looked up at the head on the wall. The head stared straight across the cabin, eyes wide with pain and terror and madness.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The assassin had died not long after they’d set out on their long journey towards Ulubis, the upper set of fangs finally penetrating his brain deeply enough to produce death. The Archimandrite had had the fellow’s eyelids slit open again when the medical people said death was likely within a few days; he’d wanted to see the look on the man’s face when he died.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous had been asleep when death had finally come for the nameless assassin, but he’d watched the recording many times. (All that happened was that the man’s face stopped contorting, his eyes rolled backwards and then came slowly back down, slightly cross-eyed, while the life-signs read-out accompanying the visuals registered first the heart stopping and then a few minutes later the brain flat-lining. Luseferous would have preferred something more dramatic, but you couldn’t have everything.) He’d had the fellow’s head removed and mounted near that of the rebel chief Stinausin, pretty much in the first head’s eye line, so that was what Stinausin had to look at all day.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Archimandrite glanced up at the staring, nameless head. ‘What do you think?’ He looked over the passage again, lips moving but not actually reading it aloud. He pursed his lips. ‘I think I agree with what’s being said, but I can’t help feeling there’s a hint of criticism implied at the same time.’ He shook his head, closed the ancient book and glanced at the cover. ‘Never heard of him,’ he muttered.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But at least, he reflected, this holier-than-thou intellectual had a name. It had come to annoy Luseferous rather a lot that he didn’t have a name for the failed assassin. Yes, the fellow had failed, yes, he had paid dearly for his crime, and yes, he was dead and now reduced to a mere trophy. But somehow the fact that his name had never been revealed had begun to strike Luseferous as almost a kind of triumph for the assassin, as though successfully withholding this nugget of information meant that Luseferous’s victory over the wretch would never quite be complete. He had already sent word back to Leseum to have the matter investigated more thoroughly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">His chief personal secretary appeared behind the sheet of mirrored diamond forming the main inner door of the stateroom-study.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir, the Marshal Lascert, sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Two minutes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He saw the Beyonder marshal in the primary stateroom of the Main Battle Craft <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, his fleet flagship. (Luseferous thought terms like ‘battleship’ and ‘fleet carrier’ and so on sounded old-fashioned and too common.) He’d had the craft remodelled to provide accommodation befitting his rank, but there had come a point where the naval architects had actually started to cry because letting what they called ‘voids’ grow beyond a certain volume weakened the ship too much. The result was that the stateroom wasn’t really as extensive or as intimidating as he’d have liked, so he’d had some mirrors installed and a few holo projectors which made it look bigger, though he always had the nagging feeling that people could see through the illusion. The style he’d chosen was New Brutalist: lots of exposed faux concrete and rusty pipes. He’d taken a fancy to the name but had gone off the look almost immediately.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He entered with only his private secretary going before him. Guards, courtiers, admin, army and naval people bowed as he strode past.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Marshal.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Archimandrite.’ The Beyonder marshal was a woman, dressed in light armour which looked like it had been polished up but still gave off an impression of practicality and scruffiness. She was tall, slim and proud-looking, if somewhat flat-chested for Luseferous’s taste. Bald women always repelled him anyway. She gave a formal nod that was probably the very least acknowledgement of his status that anybody who didn’t patently hate him and/or was about to die had given him for several decades. He couldn’t decide whether he found it insulting or refreshing. Two senior officers behind her were jajuejein, currently in their standard tumbleweed configuration, no part of their glittering plate armour higher than the marshal’s waist. He suspected that the woman had been selected because she was human, just because he was; almost all the Beyonder High Command were non-human.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He sat. It wasn’t really a throne, but it was an impressive seat on a dais. The Beyonder marshal could stand.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You wanted to talk, Marshal Lascert.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I speak on behalf of the Transgress, the True Free and the BiAlliance. We have wanted to talk to you for some time,’ the marshal said smoothly. Deep voice for a woman. ‘Thank you for agreeing to this meeting.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A pleasure, I’m sure. So. How goes your end of our little war? Last you heard, obviously.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It goes well, as far as we know.’ The marshal smiled. Lights reflected on her bald scalp. ‘I understand your own campaign has gone from victory to victory.’</span></div></body></html>
