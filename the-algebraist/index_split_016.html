<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After some to-ing and fro-ing, Fassin having to jog back up the step and through the doorway back into normal reality to set things up, he was able to display the image he’d taken. The long-limbed ape held up his shield and the image appeared there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, <span class="italic">that</span>?’ the man said. He stroked his short grey beard. ‘That’s something the Commander picked up a long time ago, in the days when he had command of a smaller ship. A translation into Ancient Sacred of something which I believe marks the end of an abomination, an AI.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What does it say?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It says, “I was born in a water moon. Some people, especially its inhabitants, called it a planet, but as it was only a little over two hundred kilometres in diameter, ‘moon’ seems the more accurate term. The moon was made entirely of water, by which I mean it was a globe that not only had no land, but no rock either, a sphere with no solid core at all, just liquid water, all the way down to the very centre of the globe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘“If it had been much bigger the moon would have had a core of ice, for water, though supposedly incompressible, is not entirely so, and will change under extremes of pressure to become ice. (If you are used to living on a planet where ice floats on the surface of water, this seems odd and even wrong, but nevertheless it is the case.) This moon was not quite of a size for an ice core to form, and therefore one could, if one was sufficiently hardy, and adequately proof against the water pressure, make one’s way down, through the increasing weight of water above, to the very centre of the moon.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘“Where a strange thing happened.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘“For here, at the very centre of this watery globe, there seemed to be no gravity. There was colossal pressure, certainly, pressing in from every side, but one was in effect weightless (on the outside of a planet, moon or other body, watery or not, one is always being pulled towards its centre; once at its centre one is being pulled equally in all directions), and indeed the pressure around one was, for the same reason, not quite as great as one might have expected it to be, given the mass of water that the moon was made up from.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘“This was, of course,—”</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘At which point it cuts off.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought. ‘Where did it come from?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It was used by one of the anathematics that Commander Inialcah hunted down and killed as a kind of memory-death mantra, to remove any trace of what might have been in its memory. The AI concerned later turned out to have been one of those also seeking the so-called Transform. It was that pursuit which originally gave the commander an interest in the matter. The memory-death mantra he had translated and kept partly as a kind of talisman, though I believe he also always thought there might be some meaning to the specific piece the AI chose to overwrite its memories with which might prove useful if he could ever work it out, because AIs were known, as he said, for being too clever by half, and through their arrogance sometimes gave important information away. That was another reason for preserving it and keeping it constantly before him.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>In his dream, Fassin was standing with Saluus Kehar on a balcony over a volcanic caldera, full of red-hot bubbling lava. ‘We’re to gas-capable a whole load of stuff for—’ Sal was saying, when he paused, cleared his throat and waved one hand. ‘Heck,’ he continued, turning into a Dweller, but somehow with a human face and without getting any bigger. He floated out over the waves of lava. ‘Idiotic things, little Fassin. I took the original of the beast to a friend and fellow friend in the city of Direaliete. A friend and fellow friend.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin gazed at his own hands, to check that he was still himself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When he looked up, Saluus had gone and the river he was standing in had temples on both sides, up steep flights of steps the height of prison walls.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Original of what?’ he heard himself ask.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>The far side of the river showed a city from the age of waste, all medium-rise buildings, smoke and electric trains and multi-lane roads full of roaring cars and trucks. They had to raise their voices a little to make themselves heard over the noise. A sweet, oily burning smell wafted over the river towards them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ginger ape picked its gleaming teeth with a giant sword.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Another image?’ the man said. He looked fit in a lean way and was no longer young. His beard was mostly grey. ‘Let me see.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Knowing what to do this time, Fassin showed the man the little image-leaf which depicted yellow sky and brown clouds.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Obviously the colour’s wrong,’ he told the man. ‘I couldn’t help noticing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, yes, there’s an image there. I see it.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know, but what—?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And some algebra, ciphered into the base code.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">At that, the ape’s long, curved sword came sweeping down and cut the man through, slicing him from neck to hip. The remains gushed down the steps to the river and wriggled away, all silver.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up at the great ape. ‘Hey,’ he said, ‘it was just a—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who’s clever?’ the ape hissed, drawing back the terrible, glittering sword.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin woke up shaking. He was in a coffin - he’d just hit his head on the inside of the lid. He tried to blink and couldn’t because something was in his eyes, surrounding them, surrounding every part of him, filling his mouth and nose and anus . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Shock-gel, gillfluid, the gascraft. <span class="italic">Fucking calm down</span>, he told himself. <span class="italic">How long you been a Seer again?</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>, the ex-Voehn craft en route for Nasqueron, Ulubis via the Direaliete system, under the command of the self-confessed twin AI Quercer &amp; Janath, pirates and close-combat Voehn-wasting specialists.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were back under moderate deceleration, on their way into the system and the hidden wormhole.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The details of the dream were starting to slip away from him, fish sine-waving goodbye through the water. And yet he felt he’d understood something. What had it been?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Confusing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something about Saluus, and had Hatherence been in there too? Sal’s house, only it had been a volcano, then the virtual environment where he met the ship, and it had looked at—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the shock-gel, pickled in it, surrounded by it, Fassin felt his eyes go wide and his skin prickle and crawl. His heart spasmed, thudding erratically in his chest.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>He could do it himself. He could wait until they got back, back to Nasq. and Ulubis, and take it to somebody - if he found Valseir he could just ask him, though he didn’t think he’d be able to find Valseir - but that wasn’t good enough. He had to know.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d committed the image-leaf to the gascraft’s memory. Lying there in the shock-gel, inside the little arrowhead, he called the photograph up and saw it floating before him. The picture of blue sky and white clouds looked odd to him, half-alien and wrong, and yet half-familiar at the same time, invoking a feeling of something between nostalgia and homesickness.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He blew the image up to the point where it became a blocky abstract of colour. He scanned the whole image for smaller images, found nothing, then started running various routines that the gascraft’s biomind held for finding patterns in random data. Had he recorded the image in fine enough detail to find anything hidden in it? Would the hidden data, if it was there, be findable without some other code?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He wished he could access the original, stowed in a tiny locker on the outside of the gascraft, but he couldn’t, not while he was pinned under this sort of force. Anyway, it might look suspicious to Quercer &amp; Janath if he started peering too intently at the image-leaf. Because that was where the answer might lie, where it might - just, perhaps, maybe - have been lying all the time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘. . . I took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in Deilte, a city in the south polar region, within a safekeep box . . .’ That, or something very like it, was what Valseir had said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had recorded the conversation verbatim in the gascraft’s memory, but it had been wiped aboard the <span class="italic">Isaut</span>. Didn’t matter; he had a pretty good memory for detail himself. He hadn’t realised at the time what the implication of Valseir’s remark was - the Mercatorial ships had tried to mount their raid on the ships in the storm fleet shortly afterwards and things had all gone a bit exciting - but it meant there was probably a copy. Valseir was a scholar, and punctilious about word use and the terminology of editions and precedence. He wouldn’t have talked about the original of something unless there was a need to distinguish it from a copy. So there was a copy. There was a back-up, and it had amused the old Dweller to have Fassin carry it with him all the time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, it was a plausible-enough theory.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin thought it would be a Valseir-like thing to have done, but he’d been wrong about the old Dweller before. Dwellers did become set in their ways and predictable, sometimes, given the ages they could live to, but sometimes they just became more devious, too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He fell asleep, the routines running on in front of him, and dreamed of streams of numbers, liquid algebra full of equations and meanings that started to make sense and then - just as he tried to study them and understand them - broke up and wriggled away, flickering to chaos.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A soft chime woke him up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was in the gascraft, in the stolen Voehn ship. The deceleration felt gentler, as though they might be approaching their goal. He clicked to an outside view and saw an orange-red sun, dead ahead. The Dweller-shaped bulk in the seat ahead twisted fractionally.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fassin?’ Quercer &amp; Janath said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">If he hadn’t been in the shock-gel inside the gascraft, he’d have jumped.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Mmm?’ he said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Going to have to put you in your own little cell for the next bit, all right?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes. I understand.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Soon as we’re at one gee standard.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I hear and obey,’ he said, trying to sound unconcerned.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Back in the gascraft’s math-space, Fassin had a result.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was indeed data hidden in the image-leaf’s depiction of a partially clouded blue sky. It had been there all the time. He’d had the answer, if that was really what it was, with him from the start.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It looked like alien algebra.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He tried to understand it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It meant nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It might mean everything.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The Archimandrite Luseferous had a tight, unpleasant feeling in his guts. He recognised it. It was the feeling that he got when he might have left something too late, or just got something wrong somehow. It was the feeling of being in a game and realising you might have made a terrible mistake a couple of turns or moves ago, of wanting to go back and undo what had been done, right the wrong, fix the error.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When he’d been a child playing a game against another child and had made a mistake, he’d sometimes just say, ‘Oh, look, I didn’t mean to do that earlier, I meant to do <span class="italic">this</span> . . .’ and had discovered that even though such behaviour might be forbidden by the rules of the game, you could get away with it amazingly often. At first he’d thought this was because he was just a more powerful character than whoever he was playing against, until he’d realised that the people this sort of tactic worked against tended to be those whose fathers weren’t nearly as powerful as his. Later he’d become powerful himself, and found that cheating was still a workable tactic. Later still, he’d found that he didn’t need to cheat. He could make the most awful blunder and never suffer for it because his opponent, guessing what was good for them in the greater context of life beyond the game, would never dare take advantage of that mistake. It was a kind of invincibility.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Machines were different; they usually wouldn’t let you make illegal moves or take back earlier errors. So you just reset them, or went back to the saved position or a time when the mistake could be unmade.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Only this was not a game, or - if it was - it was one in which Luseferous didn’t know how you changed the rules or swept your arm across the board or hit the <span class="italic">Delete All</span> sequence. Maybe the end of the game was death, and he’d wake to find himself in the greater reality that the Truth had always maintained existed. That was a sort of comfort, though even then he didn’t want to wake up after a failure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Time was the problem. Time and the fucking Dwellers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> swung ponderously into orbit around the planet Nasqueron. He watched it from his new flagship, the Main Fleet Combat Craft <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> (a super-battleship in all but name, he’d be prepared to concede).</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Insufficient time. How had it come to this? If he hadn’t delayed so long before starting, if he hadn’t stopped off along the way, if he hadn’t, perhaps, insisted on full fleet dispositional discipline . . . and yet he’d swung into action much more quickly than some democratic or committee-based organisation could have, and he would have been mad to leave strongholds intact along his line of advance and . . . and return. And discipline was important, keeping everything together was important. It symbolised loyalty, it betokened military and personal discipline.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So there had been no choice, really. They’d got here as quickly as they could. The fucking Beyonders should have warned him the Summed Fleet squadrons were coming quicker than they’d anticipated. It was all their doing. It might even be a conspiracy against him. Oh, they’d taken part in the attacks on Ulubis when it had suited them, though they’d never been as decisive as they could and should have been. Fucking whining lily-livered moralists. Military targets! So they preserved their precious fucking scruples and left him to do the dirty work. If they’d been as emphatic and ruthless as he’d been, things might have turned out differently. Instead they’d supported him just enough to bring him here but now that he was where they’d wanted him all along, they were deserting him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous wished now that he hadn’t let the Liss woman go. He’d given Saluus Kehar, the industrialist guy, back to his own people, largely to see what they’d do. Would they believe him when he told them he’d been kidnapped? Or not? Jury still out; the Guard had taken him for questioning. The woman who’d kidnapped him, and who had asked to take him back personally when she’d heard that was what the Archimandrite had in mind, had disappeared before she’d even handed him over, probably returning to her Beyonder pals. Stupid to have let a potential lever like that go, but he’d had so many other things on his mind, and the full extent of the Beyonders’ betrayal hadn’t been clear at the time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Where were their craft? Where were their invasion troops or occupying forces? They were still staying on the outskirts, still not coming into the system itself, still too scared to commit themselves. They’d professed horror and disappointment at his destruction of the city and the habitat, and at the way his troops had reacted to some elements of resistance. Fuck them! This was a fucking war! How the fuck did they think you won one? Casualties had been almost disappointingly <span class="italic">light</span>; Luseferous couldn’t remember a full-scale invasion campaign which had ended with so few dead. They’d arrived in such overwhelming numbers that there had been little the other side could do apart from die pointlessly, surrender or run.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d had a bit of luck, too, and the intelligence provided by the Beyonders about military preparations and fleet dispositions had made a bit of a difference as well, he supposed. But basically it was just big guns and plenty of them that had done the trick, and the really impressive space battles he’d kind of been hoping for just hadn’t materialised.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So the system was his, even if the only ground he’d trodden personally was when making one brief appearance at a small mansion in the middle of a jungle to accept the formal surrender of the Hierchon. He’d have preferred the symbolic value of the big spherical palace in Borquille, even if it was damaged, but the security people felt there was still a danger from a well-hidden nuke or something equally unpleasant, so a house in the middle of nowhere it had been. The Hierchon and his people were being held aboard the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>. Let the Summed Fleet kill him if that was the way it had to be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Beyonders reported that there had been a few engagements with elements of the Ulubine Mercatoria military which had turned tail to run and then encountered their forces. But even there the Archimandrite was hearing rumours that the fleeing Navarchy ships were being allowed to surrender, or even accept a sort of neutral internment, still fully crewed and armed, rather than being destroyed or captured.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So Luseferous was alone again, abandoned by his treacherous allies. They’d lured him here, got him to remove part of the threat against them, and now no doubt hoped that he’d take on the Summed Fleet squadrons when they arrived, doing the work they were too cowardly to do themselves.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, the strategists and tacticians were seriously considering cutting their losses and heading back home again. This would seem ignominious to some, but if it was the best thing to be done then that was all there was to it. Again, he’d kept calm when he’d first heard this latest galling concept. He wasn’t stupid; he could see the situation for himself. Do what the enemy least expected, what they would least want you to do.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They might - it was still just a might - set off back for the relative safety of Epiphany 5, far away across the empty regions of space they’d spent all those years crossing. It would be unfortunate, but it might be the best thing to do all the same. They’d have to leave a lot of ships behind and they’d certainly have to abandon the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> - it was too slow and too tempting a target - but they could do it. They’d leave behind sufficient forces to force the Summed Fleet to first fight within the system and then station some craft there, they’d take only the fastest ships and so have a head start, and they’d hope to lure away the main part of the remainder of the Summed Fleet squadrons - the bit that would be likely to come after them - by sending the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> and a small escort screen of lesser ships off in a different direction.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was a horrible thing to have to think about, this running away so soon after getting here and achieving complete victory. But it might be better than standing and fighting when the outcome of the resulting battle was so finely balanced.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Or, of course, they could find what they had really come for. This Dweller List key, this Transform, this magic formula. With that in his possession, Luseferous would have a bargaining counter of almost infinite value. So he was told, anyway, and for the sake of their own hides his advisers had better be utterly spot-on right with this one. Literally. He’d have the fuckers skinned alive if they’d led him all this way for nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the meantime, one last throw, one final chance to find what they’d come for. All far too rushed and desperate, but - like all the greatest leaders - the Archimandrite knew that he was at his best when he was under pressure, when the odds were against him and victory was far from certain. Of course, this didn’t happen very often to him because he didn’t allow it to - always better to win easily - but he’d had his share of narrow victories and pressure situations in the past and come out on top, and he hadn’t forgotten and he certainly hadn’t lost his touch. He knew he would prevail. He always did. Victory was the only thinkable option.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He could do it. He just had to be decisive and determined. That was what he was best at. It was almost better this way; with so little time, with just the one chance, there was no question that it had to be an all-or-nothing, no-holds-barred approach. There was simply no time to go through all the other more ‘reasonable’ techniques. Forget playing it calm and quiet, fuck diplomacy, abandon all thought of being reasonable and hoping people would be reasonable in return. Just fucking do it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Archimandrite had made his preparations as best he could. The tacticians thought the first elements of the Summed Fleet could be hurtling past at near-light speed in less than a dozen days, with the rest not far behind. No more waiting. It was now or never.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4">They were in the belly of the great ship. The hideous, swirling, hallucinogenic face of Nasqueron lay beneath their feet, visible through diamond film. The Archimandrite had risked coming aboard the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> for this. If there was some attack on it - unlikely, but not impossible, so far ahead of the main part of the Summed Fleet squadrons - then it would almost certainly have to come from above, and the sheer bulk of the vessel ought to protect them. He had the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> waiting immediately underneath the main hull nearby, linked by a short ship-to-ship. He could be out of his impressively large seat, across the chamber and aboard and away in a minute. To be on the safe side, he had dressed in an emergency esuit, a thin, constrictive but reassuring presence beneath his formal robes. The collar-helmet was hidden by his cowl, which, like the rest of his outer garment, was made of tanned Voehn blizzardskin.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Cradled against the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span>, now that it had been fully checked for bugs and bombs, was the ship that the Liss woman had used to bring the man Saluus Kehar to him. The tech people were very impressed with it. They thought it could probably outrun any ship the other side had. Luseferous would have been more impressed if it could outrun any missile or beam the other side had.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were here for a conference, a meeting ostensibly to discuss how the new regime in power within the rest of Ulubis system might liaise with the Dwellers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Hierchon Ormilla was present, as was the rest of the surviving Mercatoria top brass. There hadn’t really been time to start serious alterations on the Mercatorial power structure, and when he’d found that, as the Beyonders had reported, the Mercatoria was disliked and resented by most of its citizens/subjects, but not actively hated by them, Luseferous had left the bulk of the civil authorities in place. The main players had all pledged allegiance to him, apart from Fleet Admiral Brimiaice, who’d been killed in action, the Shrievalty colonel Somjomion, who’d disappeared and was probably on one of the ships that had run away, and the Cessorian Clerk-Regnant, Voriel, who’d chosen death rather than what he seemed to regard as the dishonour of recanting his religious vows. Idiot. Luseferous had shot him himself.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d had some of the people who’d been involved in the Dweller Embassy - set up a few months before the invasion - brief him on what to expect from the floats. Most of the Embassy people had been killed when the commander of the ship they were in had refused to surrender, but a few had survived. Luseferous wasn’t sure he trusted them, though.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Three of his own top half-dozen commanders were present too. The rest were engaged elsewhere, keeping an armed presence wherever it might be needed and preparing for the anticipated high-speed pass-through of the Summed Fleet’s advance units.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">No Beyonders, of course. They were still in shock from his unconscionable behaviour in the matter of the single small city and a habitat full of artists, weirdos and do-gooders. He must tell them he’d only chosen the city - whatever it was called, he’d forgotten - because it was on the coast and sheltered by mountains, so that he could do his sculpting trick again. That would horrify them all over again, with luck.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The - delegates? representatives? whatever the fuck they were - from the Dweller side were an unprepossessing bunch. They looked big and impressive, especially in their giant wheel-like esuits, but there was the - apparently perennial - Dweller problem of finding somebody with sufficient authority to speak for a whole planet. He’d learned early on in his career that Dwellers were best avoided. Leave them alone and they’d leave you alone. He wouldn’t have chosen to have anything whatsoever to do with the damn floats if he could possibly have avoided it. But he couldn’t, so he was doing his best.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Present were three Dwellers. All were supposedly as senior as each other, and they were each alone - no aides or secretaries or underlings of any sort, which with any other species would have indicated that these were not serious people at all but with Dwellers meant nothing in particular.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were Feurish, some sort of political scholar who spoke for the great red-brown equatorial band they could see beneath them, Chintsion, who was the current chief-of-chiefs of an umbrella organisation representing all their clubs and other voluntary organisations (sounded insulting, but allegedly their ‘clubs’ included their supposedly highly effective military) and Peripule, who was the City Administrator of their largest city, though this was not a capital city in the accepted sense, and apparently being voted to be City Administrator was regarded as an imposition, not an honour or a chance to enjoy power. They all had grandiose-sounding titles that didn’t really mean anything. All they did was tell you how old the Dwellers were.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Archimandrite would have preferred more obviously senior people - if such a thing existed in Dweller society - and more of them, but he had to work with what was to hand, especially given the time constraints. They did have other Dwellers on the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, however - over three hundred of them. Two whole shiploads of adolescents and young adults had been welcomed aboard for an extended tour as part of what sounded like a school trip for grown-ups. An alien-ship enthusiasts club, apparently. He would never have allowed this normally.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous was fairly certain that he didn’t really have the Dwellers’ full attention. His alien-watching experts advised him that the majority of the population of Nasqueron was unconcerned about the small war that had just taken place and the presence of the invasion fleet. In fact, the majority didn’t even know what had happened and would be unlikely to care. The planet’s news services, such as they were, were full of reports concerning something called a Formal War taking place between two of the atmospheric bands. This appeared to be a form of extreme sport played out on a vast scale, rather than what Luseferous would regard as a proper war. They were playing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, he would just have to see what he could do to make them take proper notice of him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Suspended over the vast view, the attendees seemed to hang as though about to fall. Above them, on a network of gantries, Luseferous’s personal guard stalked in exoskels, the pads of their claw-feet stalking with a steady, silent precision.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Let’s get to the point,’ Luseferous said after some desultory inconsequentialities had gone on far too long. ‘We want the Seer Fassin Taak,’ he told the Dwellers. ‘Even more to the point, we want certain information he’s supposed to have been looking for.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘What information?’ Chintsion asked. The ‘clubs’ chief was proving the most voluble of the three Dwellers so far. His huge esuit sat cradled in a sling-seat poised over the shallow concavity of diamond film beneath, the planet’s bilious reflected light shining faintly up from underneath him. His esuit was grey, with garish pink chevrons.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are not at liberty to divulge that,’ Luseferous told the Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Why not?’ asked the scholar, Feurish. His esuit was a kind of dirty white.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I can’t tell you,’ Luseferous said. He held up a gloved, ringed hand. ‘And please don’t ask why. Just accept this.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dwellers were silent. They were probably signalling to each other. His tech people had warned him of this and had attempted to design the sling-seats so that the creatures couldn’t communicate like that. But as soon as the Dwellers had seen the seating arrangements they’d protested and fussed and started pulling and prodding and attempting to reconfigure their seats and even began rearranging them so that they were in positions relative to each other which they liked better. Luseferous had ground his diamond teeth, signalled to the tech people to help, and waited for the Dwellers to declare themselves happy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Finally they were all sitting in a great circle, the Dwellers and the Hierchon and his handful of advisers forming most of one half of the circumference, the humans and others, including the Archimandrite, making up the other half.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We don’t know where Seer Fassin Taak is,’ Chintsion told Luseferous. ‘Last heard of, he was making for a city in the northern polar region called Eponia. Though that is just a rumour.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Eponia?’ the third Dweller, Peripule, said. His esuit was deep, gleaming brown, frilled like seaweed. ‘I heard he was seen in Deilte.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Deilte?’ Chintsion said scornfully. ‘At this time of year?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘He is an alien,’ Peripule said. ‘He knows nothing of fashion.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, first of all,’ Chintsion began, ‘he has a minder, and—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Gentlemen,’ Luseferous said. The three Dwellers all rocked back as though shocked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘The Archimandrite Luseferous is a busy man,’ the Hierchon Ormilla boomed. ‘Discussions regarding the seasonal fashionability of cities in Nasqueron might be best conducted between sessions, not during.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Little dweller,’ Chintsion said to the Hierchon, ‘we are, as a favour to your latest batch of masters, and notwithstanding the likely and faintly hilarious brevity of their precedence, attempting to establish the whereabouts of this Taak fellow. The . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous stopped listening. He turned to Tuhluer, who sat just behind and to the side of him. He looked the other man in the eye. Tuhluer held his gaze. Luseferous saw the other man swallow. Still his gaze was held. Tuhluer had never dared to do that before. Luseferous bent fractionally towards him and said quietly, ‘Desperate times require desperate solutions, Tuhluer.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The other man looked down, then nodded and started finger-tapping signals into his glove. The Archimandrite turned to the front again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A distant thud sounded, followed a second later by another, then another, like a great clock ticking.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous listened to the two Ulubine Peregals, old men called Tlipeyn and Emoerte, trying to wheedle the Dwellers into being more cooperative. The Dwellers gave every indication of being sincerely unable even to understand what the word meant.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Out of the corner of his eye, minutely silhouetted against the filthy yellow-brown clouds of the planet beneath them, the Archimandrite could see a line of tiny specks drifting off to one side, heading towards the passing cloud tops thousands of kilometres below.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘. . . Believe us when we say that we are serious,’ Commander Binstey, his C-in-C of ground forces was saying to the three Dwellers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, I’m sure you are,’ Chintsion said airily. ‘That does not alter the fact that we may be entirely unable to help you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Commander Binstey started to speak again but then Luseferous interrupted him. ‘Gentlemen,’ he said quietly, and Binstey fell silent. ‘If I may direct your attention to the view over to one side there.’ He waved one ringed hand over to the side where the stippled line of specks was moving slowly across the gasily distorted face of the planet.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Everybody looked. The Dwellers twisted slightly in their seats. Those present in the chamber with especially good eyesight were already reacting. He could hear mutters, gasps, all the usual expressions of shock.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We are serious,’ Luseferous told the Dwellers. He stood. ‘Do you hear that noise?’ He turned his head, as though listening. The dull ticking noise went on; steady, remorseless. ‘That is a drop-bomb chute, firing once a second. Only in this case it is firing people, not warheads. Unprotected human beings are being thrown into space towards your planet at a rate of over three thousand per hour. They are men, women and children, old and young adults, people from all walks of life, mostly captured from surrendered ships and damaged habitats. We have over twenty thousand of them aboard. They will continue to be fired at this rate until we make some sort of progress here.’ He waited for some sort of reaction from the three Dwellers, but they just kept on looking at the view. ‘Now,’ he continued, ‘do any of us here present think we might have just remembered anything useful?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He watched the people and the aliens staring at the stippled line of black dots moving slowly away from the great ship. A few people turned to look at him, then looked away when he met their gaze, trying to hide hatred and fear and horror. Odd how people reacted so severely to something unpleasant happening right in front of them but were prepared to ignore much worse horrors taking place elsewhere.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He nodded to Tuhluer, and a great screen lit up across one side of the chamber, showing the process. People - humans of all sorts, as he’d said - were shown being loaded into a number of huge circular magazines. The humans were almost all struggling, but they were each constrained by a tight wrapping like an elastic sleeping bag which covered every bit of them except for their faces and prevented them from doing anything but squirm like maggots and spit at and try to bite the exoskel-wearing soldiers loading them into the launcher magazines. The floor of the vast hold was covered in wriggling, struggling bodies. The sound turned up, and those present in the conference chamber could hear the humans screaming and crying and shouting and begging.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Archimandrite!’ the Hierchon shouted. ‘I have to protest at this! I didn’t—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shut up!’ the Archimandrite bellowed at him. He looked round the others. ‘All of you! Not a fucking word!’ For a while the only sound was the muffled thud, thud, thud of the launcher.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The scene switched to the muzzle of the launcher on the exterior of the ship, firing - very gently, for a gun - the people into space. Their wrapping came off as they were expelled, snapping back around their ankles so that they could writhe and jerk and spasm satisfactorily as they met the vacuum naked, and suffocated. Some tried to hold their breaths, and bulged fit to explode. Blood specked from ears and eyes and mouths and anuses. The cameras followed them. The people usually moved for about a couple of minutes before they stopped. Then they just assumed the one frozen pose - some curled foetal, some spreadeagled - and tumbled slowly, part of an invisible conveyor belt, towards the faraway cloud tops.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Exactly why are you doing this?’ the Dweller Feurish asked the Archimandrite. He sounded merely puzzled.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘To concentrate minds,’ Luseferous said coldly. He could hear somebody being sick in the chamber. Not many people were meeting his gaze. The gantries above were thick with immobile guards, weapons already trained on the people below.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, my mind was perfectly concentrated,’ Feurish said, with what sounded like a sigh. ‘We still can’t help you.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Give me Seer Fassin Taak,’ Luseferous said, feeling some sweat - what? - start to break out on his forehead. He put a stop to that at once.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘We haven’t got this Taak fellow,’ the City Administrator Peripule said reasonably.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Tell me where he is,’ Luseferous demanded.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sorry,’ Chintsion said. ‘Can’t help.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fucking <span class="italic">tell</span> me!’ Luseferous roared.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘How can we—?’ Feurish began. Then Chintsion broke in.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Perhaps we can ask the people who claim to have seen Seer Taak last where they think he might be.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There were people from the Embassy who were reported to be looking for him,’ Feurish pointed out. ‘Perhaps they found something.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I thought they were all killed when the Embassy ships were destroyed,’ Chintsion said. ‘Weren’t they?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Look,’ Peripule said reasonably to the Archimandrite. ‘Why don’t we just sleep on it, eh?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous pointed furiously at the line of bodies heading slowly towards the planet. ‘Don’t you <span class="italic">fuckwits</span> understand? <span class="italic">That</span> doesn’t stop until I get what I want!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The three Dwellers twisted to look as one. ‘Hmm,’ Peripule said thoughtfully. ‘I do hope you have enough people.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous’s fists clenched. He felt close to exploding, as though he was one of the people in the little production line of death sliding past the bowed diamond window. He struggled to keep his voice icily calm as he said, ‘There are three hundred Dweller youngsters aboard this ship. Perhaps if we used them instead? Or for target practice. What do you think?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I think you’ll annoy people,’ Chintsion said, and laughed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’re not seriously trying to use threats against us, are you?’ Feurish asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I had better point out, Mr Luseferous,’ Chintsion said with what sounded almost like humour, ‘that some of the clubs I represent are of a military bent. Wonderfully enthusiastic, of course, proud to personify them, naturally, but sometimes - I don’t know, perhaps through boredom - they display characteristics which might almost be said to be bordering on those one would expect to be evinced by fellows of a “shoot-first” mentality. Ah. If you know what I mean.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous stared at this cretinous float. The plodding, thud, thud, thud sound went on. The line of tiny dark shapes continued to move across the tortured, livid face of the gas-giant. He turned to Tuhluer. ‘Go to full action stations,’ he said. ‘Dark the view.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The vast face of Nasqueron disappeared as the diamond bubble went obsidian black. The whole great chamber grew still darker and seemed to shrink. The thudding noise sounded louder.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You three are to be held hostage,’ Luseferous told the three Dwellers. ‘As will the young of your kind currently aboard this ship. If there is any attempt to rescue you or them, or any assault on this ship or on any of my ships or assets, you will all be killed. If I don’t get something provably useful on Seer Fassin Taak or whatever it was he was looking for in the next six hours standard, I’m going to start killing you anyway, starting with you three. Understand?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Really, Mr Luseferous,’ Feurish said, ‘this is no way to run a conference.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I have to say that I have to agree,’ Chintsion said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shut up,’ Luseferous told them. ‘I also have numerous ships with multi-real-tonne antimatter warheads stationed right round this gas-giant. Planet-busters. If there’s still nothing happening after you’re all dead, I start detonating them in your precious fucking atmosphere. What passes for the authorities on your giant rotten fart of a planet will be informed of the above in due course.’ The Archimandrite looked up at the guards poised on the gantries above. ‘Take them away. Get them out of those esuits. By cutting if necessary.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A dozen giant black figures like suits of ancient armour encrusted with huge dark jewels sailed down, landing on the black diamond film on great talon-spread legs. Four surrounded each of the three esuited Dwellers.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, gentlemen,’ the Dweller called Peripule said ruefully to the other two, ‘I suppose it is not open to us to claim we went unwarned.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">An instant later, three violet circular curtains of light blazed out within the dark chamber, one encircling each Dweller. The exoskel guards were either rocked right back or physically blown over. Those unprotected people standing or sitting further away were picked up and thrown towards the walls. The shock wave hit Luseferous’s tall seat a fraction after the safety shield deployed, so that he watched the resulting chaos through a clinker of half-silvered diamond shutters.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The blast shook his seat, shook him and then reflected and echoed back off the distant walls. The three violet cylinders disappeared and left three huge neatly circular holes in the black diamond film beneath. The sickly light of Nasqueron’s yellow-brown cloud tops shone through. The air in the chamber was whirling and screaming out through the apertures. Blinks of white light flickered outside. Two of the exoskel guards were tumbled across the floor, scrabbling for grip, and were sucked out of the holes. Luseferous just stood staring. People, mostly unconscious and badly injured, started to slide in from the edges of the chamber where they’d been deposited by the triple blasts towards the three shining holes. A third exoskeleton-clad figure was being pulled, giant hands scraping and scrabbling frantically at the smooth diamond surface, towards the nearest hole and the whirling vortex forming above it. Then the ship’s systems finally woke up to what was happening and a dark shape flicked across the three puncture wounds in the vessel’s skin, sealing off the light and keeping what remained of the atmosphere within.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Relative calm returned. The thud, thud, thud noise continued. A rushing sound signalled replacement air being pumped back into the chamber. The exoskel guards got to their feet, looked around, then ran over to form a protective shield about the Archimandrite. More black shapes came plummeting from the gantries. Luseferous could hear people in the chamber moaning. He turned to look at Tuhluer, who was limping up to him through the phalanx of exoskel guards, his own emergency esuit and helmet deployed, the shiny bulge of faceplate reflecting the silvery diamond bubble that enclosed the Archimandrite and his chair.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Kill the other Dwellers,’ Luseferous told him. Tuhluer leaned in, hand to the side of his head, seemingly not hearing. ‘KILL THE OTHER DWELLERS!’ Luseferous shouted. He clicked a stud on the arm of the seat and the diamond shuttering fell away. ‘Get us away from here,’ he told the other man. ‘Warn the planet the AM warheads launch in three hours if they don’t start cooperating.’ He looked at where the three Dweller representatives had made their sudden exit. ‘And make sure the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> wasted those three comedians.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir!’ Tuhluer said. ‘And what about the . . . chute supply?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It took a moment before Luseferous realised that he meant the people being launched towards the planet. He waved one hand. ‘Oh, dump the lot.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Archimandrite Luseferous clicked the esuit’s communicator and told the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> he was on his way. He marched through the moaning wounded towards the ship-to-ship and the waiting vessel beneath. The exoskel guards fell in around him, forming a giant hedge of armoured limbs and menacingly jagged torsos. He was almost at the ship-to-ship entrance when he was thrown off his feet. The exoskels staggered as the whole vast ship shook. One of the giant guards nearly fell on him, regaining his balance only at the last moment, servos whining.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Now</span> what?’ Luseferous demanded.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Damage control here, sir,’ a voice said from the esuit. ‘Energy bolt straight through the whole ship, dead amidships. About two metres diameter. Plus . . . the bows have been shot off, back . . . to . . . about . . . the eighty-metre mark. Just gone. Same novel energy profile as the midships beam. Light speed; zero warning. Reactive defence systems still looking for a countermeasure against any subsequent usage . . . nothing coming up so far, sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Comms, sir,’ another voice said, ‘Dwellers, demanding return of their people aboard. Apparently those were just warning shots.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Tuhluer came striding up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Luseferous looked at him. ‘Hand the Dwellers back,’ he told the ADC. ‘Then get this thing away from here.’ He strode towards the ship-to-ship.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And the AM ships, sir?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Leave them where they are. Delay the ultimatum until the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> is clear.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This time the Archimandrite made it all the way to the waiting flagship.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>An hour later the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> was still making its lumbering, injured way out of the planet’s gravity well. The <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> was already half a million klicks away and still accelerating. The Archimandrite - still shaking with rage even in his acceleration couch, the full awfulness and sheer <span class="italic">insult</span> of what had happened at last sinking in, his patience finally exhausted (those three facetious shithead Dwellers had even <span class="italic">escaped</span>, esuits reflecting or deflecting everything the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span> had thrown at them after they’d exited the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, disappearing, apparently unharmed, into the cloud tops) - ordered that the ultimatum be made to the Dwellers immediately, and that one of the ships carrying an AM warhead should drop its weapon into the planet’s atmosphere, just to show that they were serious.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The reply was almost instantaneous. The ship with the AM bomb - each one of the twenty ships with the AM bombs - vanished in a sudden pinpoint flare of light. All the warheads went off partially, reacting messily with the ordinary matter debris left after the destruction of the ships. Twenty ragged little suns guttered round Nasqueron like a tilted necklace, flaring, fading, flaring again and fading slowly once more.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Moments later, a hyper-velocity missile rose out of the turgid skies of the gas-giant and found the <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> despite all its desperate countermeasures within two minutes of clearing the cloud tops.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The radiation front tripped the <span class="italic">Rapacious</span>’s sensor buffers. <span class="italic">That</span> was how a proper antimatter warhead was supposed to work, seemed to be the implication.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The last signal from the great ship before it was ripped entirely apart and turned into radiation and high-speed shrapnel was from aide-de-camp Tuhluer, calmly informing Luseferous that the Archimandrite was a cunt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Fassin Taak looked up at the stars of home. He felt tears in his eyes, even within the shock-gel. He rested on a windswept platform above a small cloud-top city low in the south polar region, just a couple of thousand kilometres from the torn, fluid boundary with Nasqueron’s southernmost atmospheric belt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He tried to locate a friendly satellite, some signal that the little gascraft could recognise, but he couldn’t find anything. All broadcast signals were either terribly weak or scrambled, and he couldn’t locate any low-orbit devices to bounce a hail off. He tried to lock on to one of the weak broadcast wavelengths and use the gascraft’s biomind to decipher the signals, but the routines didn’t seem to be working. He gave up. For the moment, he was content just to sit here and look out at the few, familiar stars.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Despite Y’sul’s injuries, they’d still had to undergo an albeit slightly gentler form of the wild spiralling. Fassin had lain in the gascraft, feeling the series of nested corkscrewings and helixes build up like some coiling spring, thinking that this was them entering the wormhole, though in fact, as it turned out, they’d already been through it and this was the unwinding. Then, suddenly, they were here, back in Nasqueron, in the southern polar region, not the northern one they’d left from.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sinking down just a few kilometres through the cloud tops, the ex-Voehn ship <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> had come to rest in a slightly too-big cradle in an enormous, echoing cavern of a hangar here in the lower regions of the nearly deserted polar city of Quaibrai. The City Administrator and a crowd of several hundred Dwellers had met them, hooting and throwing streamers and scent grenades.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A delegation comprising individuals from several different alien-ship enthusiast clubs had become particularly excited when they’d seen the Voehn craft and had bobbed up and down with impatience as Y’sul had been carefully offloaded and given into the care of a hospital squad. As soon as Y’sul, Fassin and the truetwin Quercer &amp; Janath had exited, the chirping, sizzling mass of enthusiasts rushed aboard, jostling for position as they’d tried to fit down the corridors and access ways. The truetwin had, thoughtfully, expanded the ship from its needle-ship portal-piercing formation to a fatter and hence more commodious configuration, but it still looked like a tight squeeze.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Y’sul, already looking half mended, though still shaking off the grogginess of his semi-coma, had twisted a fraction in his scoop-stretcher to look at Fassin as the hospital squad brought their ambulance skiff down to him. ‘See?’ he’d croaked. ‘Got you back safely, didn’t I?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had agreed that he had. He’d tried to pat Y’sul but used the wrong manipulator and instead just jerked in mid-gas. He’d swivelled and used the gascraft’s other arm, clutching the wounded Dweller’s hub-hand.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You off home now?’ Y’sul had asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘However much of it is left. I don’t know. I don’t know what to do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, if you do go, come back soon.’ Y’sul had paused and shaken himself, as though trying to wake up more fully. ‘I should be ready to receive visitors again in a couple of dozen days or so and I anticipate a very full social calendar indeed thereafter. I fully intend to exploit my recent injuries and experiences without compunction and exaggerate outrageously my part in the taking of the Voehn ship, not to mention embellish my fight with the Voehn commander to the point of what will probably seem like complete unrecognisability, the first time you hear it. I’d appreciate your corroboration, providing you are able to enter into the spirit of the thing and not insist on being overly encumbered by the vulgar exigencies of objective truth, whatever version of it you may think you recall. What do you say?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My memory’s kind of hazy,’ Fassin had told the Dweller. ‘I’ll probably back up anything you say.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Splendid!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘If I can come back, I shall.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Privately, he didn’t even know if he could get away in the first place. He didn’t know what sort of infrastructure remained to get him off the planet, get the gascraft repaired and return him - if whoever was in charge would let him return - nor whether the Dwellers would allow him to return.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">During the last part of the six-hour journey from the wormhole, when Quercer &amp; Janath had allowed him to see where they were and let him access the local data-carrying spectra, he’d tapped into the Nasqueron news services to see what had been going on during his absence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller news was all about the war. The Formal War between Zone 2 and Belt C. Apparently it had become deeply exciting and enthralling and was already being talked of in respected critical circles as a classic of the genre, even though it was probably barely halfway through yet and still, with any luck at all, had a great deal to offer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had to search out a specialist alien-watcher service to find out that, starting about thirty-plus days earlier, the Ulubis system had been invaded and taken over by the Epiphany-5 Discon or Starveling Cult forces under the leadership of the Archimandrite Luseferous. The last significant, organised Ulubine Mercatorial resistance had ended just a dozen or so days ago following the formal surrender by the Hierchon Ormilla after the destruction of a city on Sepekte and a habitat in orbit around it. A counter-attack by several squadrons of the Summed Fleet was expected to commence within the next few dozen days or so. The latest was that a peace and cooperation conference was taking place about now in the Starveling ship <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span>, in orbit about Nasqueron.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had sent a message which would at least attempt to find Valseir. He would wait a bit and see if that raised a reply. He’d thought of contacting Setstyin, but then he remembered, vaguely, that somebody had said something to him that had made him uneasy about the Dweller. No, wait, it had been the other way round, hadn’t it? Setstyin had always been a charming and helpful friend. Setstyin had warned him against the old Dweller who’d been in charge of the great spherical . . . <span class="italic">thing</span> that had risen out of the clouds and demolished the Mercatoria’s raiding force at the GasClipper regatta. Yes, that made more sense. He wondered why he couldn’t remember in more detail. It was strange. He’d always had a really good memory.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Quercer &amp; Janath seemed to be surrounded by well-wishers wanting to know more about the Voehn craft. The truetwin Dweller had seen Fassin looking at them through the crowd, and waved. Fassin had waved back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d watched Y’sul being placed into the ambulance skiff and tried to work out what he knew and didn’t know, what he could and could not remember. He could have gone with Y’sul in the ambulance, he supposed, but he felt a need to get away for a while, to be alone for a time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d come up here to see the stars, and wait, and think, and maybe do a bit of mathematical analysis.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He took the little image-leaf out of its locker in the gascraft’s flank. He looked at it. Since whatever had happened aboard the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>, the little gascraft couldn’t see as well as it used to, but its close-up detail vision was good enough on one side for the image of blue sky and white clouds to be perfectly clear. He zoomed in, rechecking the image he had stored in the . . . The image wasn’t there in the craft’s memories.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">That was strange. He had the feeling that he had recorded the image and already half-deciphered something that was hidden inside it. He was sure he had. It had seemed really important at the time, too, he was certain.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin tried really hard to think back to what had occurred after they were attacked by the Voehn ship. He knew they’d been captured and interrogated and the Voehn had messed around with his brain and with the gascraft’s biomind and memories. Then a ship that the Ythyn had sent to rescue them had attacked the Voehn ship and - somehow - he and Y’sul and the truetwin had overpowered the surviving Voehn crew.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They’d overpowered Voehn?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">How had that happened? The Ythyn ship had been able to distract the Voehn, and the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> had played a part too, some sort of anti-piracy automatics kicking in and helping to take on the Voehn. Quercer &amp; Janath had been distinctly cagey about what sort of techniques their old ship had used against the Voehn.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin had no idea. Maybe it had happened the way they said, maybe not. Maybe the <span class="italic">Velpin</span> had had an AI aboard and that had wasted the Voehn, only Quercer &amp; Janath didn’t want people to know about it. They could have told him practically anything and he’d have believed them, the Voehn had messed with his memories so badly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He remembered sitting on the steps of a temple looking out over a wide, slow-moving river, talking to an old . . . man? An old Dweller? This was quite a vivid image, rather than a linear strand of memory. That had to have happened in some form of VR, didn’t it? Maybe that old man had been the representation of the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>’s AI. Perhaps that was who or what he had been talking to, or at least met.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He tried to concentrate, and looked down at the image-leaf again. He’d been given this by Valseir. Was that right? It had been a sort of calling card, a letter of introduction, leading him to . . . He seemed to feel it had led him to Valseir, but that didn’t make sense.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">No, wait: the house in the depths, and the old wandering Dweller. <span class="italic">He</span>’d given him the image-leaf. And it had led him, somehow, to Valseir. But there was something else. He’d discovered something else. He’d woken up thinking about this, before the wormhole transition. There was something hidden in the image-leaf. A message, a code.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked round the empty platform. There was nobody else here. He let the little gascraft’s image processors drink in the view shown on the image-leaf in as much detail as it could offer. Various routines started running. In a few minutes, his gaze was torn away from the sparse but familiar-looking starscape above. He looked at the results.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There had been something in there.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It looked like alien algebra.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There was about a page and a half of it. It looked like one long equation, or maybe three or four shorter ones.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He felt very excited. He wasn’t entirely sure why, but he had an idea that this linked into the Dweller List. The details evaded him, but he knew that he’d been looking for the Transform that was supposed to open up the famous List, and maybe - just possibly - this piece of alien mathematics had something to do with it. Maybe what he had before him here <span class="italic">was</span> the Transform, though that was a little difficult to believe.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin tried to figure out what the symbols in front of him might mean, but couldn’t even get started. The gascraft’s comprehensively mucked-around memories might once have contained something which would have sent him in the right direction, but they didn’t any more.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He linked with the city’s data nets, synched with an equatorial university library and looked up a data reservoir specialising in alien mathematics. He chose a couple of symbols at random and pinged them to the database. It answered immediately, with references.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">What he was looking at was expressed in Translatory V, a pan-species, universal notation of just under two billion years age, devised by the long-extinct Wopuld from earlier Dweller elements. He downloaded a full translation suite.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He had to stop, and look out over the cloud tops. He was experiencing a strange mix of emotions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">This might be the thing he’d been sent to look for, the very object of his mission. Their mission, rather; he ought not to forget Colonel Hatherence. This could well be what he’d been looking for, all that time. And yet, if the Mercatoria, or at least the Ulubine part of it, had hoped that this would save them, then it hadn’t. He’d got back too late, and the invasion had already happened. It was all over.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">And there was so much he seemed to have forgotten! What had the Voehn <span class="italic">done</span> to him? Y’sul had been badly injured but apart from the effects of his healing coma he seemed - and professed himself to be - fine, mentally. Quercer &amp; Janath didn’t seem to have suffered at all. Maybe that was just luck, or something to do with being a truetwin - he didn’t know.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Still, there was this to be done, this deciphering. It might still lead to something momentous. The invasion might have already happened but the counter-attack was still to take place, and anyway, there was his own take on the rights and wrongs of what was going on. He would still rather the Beyonders had the information, if there was any useful information to be had, in the equation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Something glinted in space just over the horizon to the west, way out across the cloud tops. A ship, perhaps.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin returned his attention to the equation and the alien translation suite. He applied one to the other. In the virtual space which the gascraft’s crippled biomind projected into his own mind, the image split and a copy of the equation appeared alongside the original. He watched the symbols shuffle and change in the copy, turning into Dweller standard notation. The symbols on both copies of the equation flickered and highlighted, turned different colours and seemed to swell out and then lapse back in again amongst the rest as the equation worked itself out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was truly an equation, too. He’d had some vague idea thanks to something that somebody had said that it might be a frequency and signal or something, but it wasn’t that. Or if it was it was very oddly disguised.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The last few terms flicked and flashed on both sides of the split image. The answer appeared right at the end, blinking slowly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was a zero.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He stared at it, at them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A zero in Dweller standard notation was a dot with a short line under it. In Translatory V, it was a diagonal slash. </span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A dot with a short line under it winked at him from the copy of the equation. A diagonal slash lay at the end of the original, also slowly flashing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He tried again. Same result.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He rechecked the image, pulled the hidden code out of it again, in case the processor systems had made a mistake the first time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There had been no mistake. The equation he came up with the second time was the same as the first. He ran that one as well, anyway.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Zero.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin laughed. He could feel himself inside the shock-gel nested within the little arrowhead craft, chest and belly shaking. He had a sudden, vivid image of standing on the rocky shore of a planet, waiting for something. He stopped laughing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Zero.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So the final answer was nothing. He’d been sent to the far side of the galaxy, had the answer with him all the time anyway, and what it was, was ‘Fuck all’. But in maths.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He started laughing again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ah well.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another glint, out over the cloud tops again, nearly directly north, and high. A scatter of tiny lights lit up the sky just beneath whatever it was that had just reflected the light. A hint of violet. Then white.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He watched the same region of space for a few moments, looking for more. Whatever it was, it had to be fairly far away. If it was the same thing that had glinted earlier near the horizon then it was something high over the equatorial zone, tens of kilo-klicks out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Zero. Well, that was illuminating. Fassin wondered if there really was a true answer somewhere, if what he’d found - what Valseir had stumbled onto and then what Fassin had unknowingly brought out with him after his long-ago delve - was part of a whole suite of decoy answers. Was there just this one, or were there more? Was the myth of the Dweller List’s famous Transform footnoted with hundreds of false answers?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Well, if it was, he wasn’t going to go looking for them. He’d done his bit. He’d even, in a sense, accomplished his mission, when he’d thought it was never going to happen. He was too late, and the result was a nonsense, a joke, almost an insult, but - by any given god you cared to name - he’d done it.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He ought to start thinking about how he was going to get off the planet, or at least get the information out there, just for form’s sake. Share the indifferent news.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another couple of flashes from space, near where the first crop had shone. One tiny blink, one longer flare. A few moments later what looked like a ship’s drive lit up and floated away, gathering speed quickly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked for evidence of any Shared Facility satellites, or indeed any Mercatorial hardware anywhere around Nasqueron. There didn’t seem to be anything. He’d told Aun Liss he’d try to ping a position between two Seer satellites, EQ4 and EQ5, but the satellites weren’t there any more. He wondered if he could work out where they would have been and so where the microsat that he’d suggested the Beyonders position between the two might be. He looked inside the gascraft’s memory, trying to find the sat schedules, dug them out, then fed in the local time and his current location.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A position blinked on his field of vision, away across the cloud tops, a little off due north, some few kilo-klicks beneath where the recent activity had been. In line of sight now. He decided to treat this piece of luck as a good omen, and sent a signal saying he was back, so that, if nothing else, he’d have done what he’d said he would do. He waited a while but there was no acknowledgement, let alone a reply. He hadn’t really expected one.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He wondered what was left of the Shrievalty Ocula, and whether he should even try to report to it. He needed to do some research into exactly how much had changed since the invasion, see whether he was listed as dead, and whether he was being looked for or not. Maybe people had forgotten about him in all the excitement.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin laughed again. Oh, if only.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The whole E-5 Discon invasion, so they’d been told, was happening quite specifically because of the List and the Transform. If that was even partly, even slightly true, and his mission hadn’t been hidden from the invaders, then they probably would be looking for him, and quite hard, too, given that they might not have much time before the Summed Fleet crashed the party.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In a way the zero-result equation was a relief. The information he’d brought back was such that he didn’t mind sharing it with anybody and everybody. If it had truly told the location of the wormhole portals it would have been the most crushingly awful burden he could have borne, an infinitely precious and probably infinitely deadly possession. He should be glad it was a joke. If it had been the useful truth, if it had been what they had all hoped it was going to be, then almost certainly no matter who he chose to tell would first torture him or at the very least tear his mind apart to make sure he was telling the truth, and then kill him to make sure he couldn’t tell anybody else. He’d kind of hoped that the Beyonders might be more humane than that, but it was a big risk to take.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d be better just broadcasting the result, then disappearing if he could. Maybe the Dwellers would let him stay.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Valseir. If nothing else, he ought to let his Dweller friend know that the information they’d all been so concerned about in fact amounted to nothing more than a piddling little zero. Then there was the matter of telling Valseir that for this nothing, his friend and colleague Leisicrofe had killed himself. Not all good news he’d arrive bearing, then.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin looked up the StormSailing news service. There were fewer regattas than usual, thanks to all the interest in the war, and a lot of sailors who’d normally be on the GasClippers and StormJammers would be required to crew the Dreadnoughts and other combat craft, but there were still a dozen meetings going on at any one time throughout the planet. If he was going to go looking for Valseir at regattas, he might have a long search.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He thought about contacting the City Administrator to arrange for transport - Y’sul would most likely be transferred back home to Hauskip city in a day or two, and Fassin could probably just accompany the injured Dweller back there - then he wondered if he ought to be more careful.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Nobody seemed to have paid him much attention at all when he’d disembarked from the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>, but that didn’t mean his arrival hadn’t been noticed by somebody. Were there any humans - other Seers or anybody else - present in Nasq.? Somebody - Valseir? Damn this suddenly failing memory - somebody had told him there were factions and differences of opinion within the Dwellers over the List and even the seemingly endemic, congenital disregard the Dwellers displayed towards the rest of the galaxy’s inhabitants. <span class="italic">We are not a monoculture</span>. That had been Valseir, hadn’t it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Would any group of Dwellers wish him ill, or somehow be under the command of somebody who did?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He called up the usually most reliable alien-watching service and accessed the global map. It was, for the first time since he’d been looking at it, completely clear. According to the display, there was not a single alien entity alive in Nasqueron. That appeared to include him, so his return hadn’t been documented yet, at least not by the enthusiasts who ran this service.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He was being called. Quercer &amp; Janath. He put the image-leaf back in its flank locker.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin. Anywhere we can take you?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Locally, hasten to add.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ship at our disposal. Favour owed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That sort of thing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I don’t know, Fassin replied. - I’ve been thinking about that. Do you know any more about what’s happening with the invasion and the Starveling Cult forces?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Getting reports coming in just now that there’s been some sort of breakdown at some conference.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Firefight, bluntly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’d like to find my friend Valseir, Fassin said. - I’ve sent a call, but no answer’s come back. I thought I might find him at a—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">As he spoke, he thought suddenly of the RushWing <span class="italic">Sheumerith</span>, the Dwellers hanging trailed on long lines behind the great long flexible wing forever powering its way into the high skies of Nasqueron. The RushWing. That was the other place Valseir had said he might be found.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes, he told the truetwin. - I do know where you could take me.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Be in-atmosphere, you realise. Not that quick.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Entirely used up our luck quotient bringing the ship into Nasq. unseen in the first place. Voehn ship, see. Nervous-making sort of thing for a lot of people. Apparently.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That’s fine, Fassin told them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>They were scudding through the cloud stems under the topmost haze layer less than an hour later when the AM warheads went off. One was directly above them.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, wow!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Look at our shadow!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A minute later, what they would later discover had been the destruction of the great ship <span class="italic">Luseferous VII</span> cast part of a giant halo of light all over the western sky. Quercer &amp; Janath freely confessed to being terribly impressed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> tore serenely on.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The first twelve ships of the Summed Fleet streaked across the inner system of Ulubis at just a per cent below light speed. Kilometre-long black minarets girdled by fast-spinning sections loosing missile clusters, pack munitions, scatter mines, stealth drones and suicide launchers, they lanced across the whole system in less than four hours, Nasqueron’s orbit in less than one and Sepekte’s in fifteen minutes.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Billions of kilometres behind them, on the same course and decelerating hard, lay the <span class="italic">Mannlicher-Carcano</span> and the main body of the Summed Fleet. Taince Yarabokin floated in her pod. In the VR command space of the battleship, there was something approaching total silence as the entire command crew lay quietly listening to the sparse exchanges beaming back from the twelve advance units darting across the system dead ahead.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince was amazed at how nervous she felt. She could feel her body trying to exhibit all the classic signs of the fight-or-flight response, and the pod’s bio systems doggedly countering each one. There was no doubt that this was an important mission. It would, arguably, be the most crucial one she’d ever been a part of. She was of sufficiently senior rank to have been briefed at the start on the strategic momentousness of what they were being sent to do, but even so she was surprised how similar she felt now to the way she’d felt on her first few combat missions. You never fully shook off the adrenalin rush no matter how many missions you undertook - the consensus was that the day you felt completely blasé about a forthcoming engagement was either the day you were going to die or the day you should resign your commission forthwith - but the way she felt now was worryingly similar to how she’d felt before those early missions.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Somewhere, her nervousness would be being noted, too. Even if a live human medical officer wasn’t watching her life signs now, a program would be flagging her current state of anxiety as worth further investigation later. No privacy. Well, she’d known that when she joined up.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince took her mind away from these perplexing, almost embarrassing feelings and watched the data coming back from the lead ships.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">What happened now, what these twelve craft discovered or didn’t discover as they crossed the system at accelerated particle speeds, would determine how the next part of her life was lived out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">There had been some odd energy and drive signatures from the system over the last few days, though nothing as bizarre as the sudden commotion around Nasqueron a few days ago. Twenty-plus antimatter explosions. All but one, it looked like, spread around the planet in a neat if wavy circle. They’d detonated too far out to do any great damage to the gas-giant itself or to its inhabitants, and the explosions had been very messy, almost as if they hadn’t been functioning warheads detonating efficiently but rather twenty - very big - ships losing M/AM containment at exactly the same time. Then, a minute or two later, an even bigger AM burst less than a light second out from Nasqueron, with the profile of something the size of the behemoth ship they’d identified earlier getting thoroughly blasted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Then nothing, apart from the ambiguous maybe-leaving indications.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Because one plausible explanation that fitted most of the signs - no explanation anyone had come up with so far fitted all of them - was that the bad guys were pulling out. Nobody in fleet command really believed this was what could be happening - the Starveling Cult force had crossed decades of space to get to Ulubis: they wouldn’t turn tail and face the equally long trek back after just a few weeks, would they? - but it looked like one of the more likely explanations.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The data about to arrive would decide it one way or the other.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The battlecruiser <span class="italic">88</span>, the advance squadron’s flagship, collating the real-time intelligence of the spearhead-shaped force and signalling it back to the main fleet, reported three heavy craft within detection though not attack range of the first, point destroyer. It signalled two of the following cruisers to adjust their trajectories and prepare remote munitions, guided and dumb. Little comms bleed. Possibly this was just good discipline or marginally better tech than they’d anticipated. Flank cruisers and destroyers reported a few missile platforms, firing at them, futilely, given their speed. A lot of mines, well spread. Evidence of AM material still floating free near the planet Nasqueron, in a debris profile that fitted exactly twenty ships having blown up at the same time eight days earlier. One big debris field, still heading outwards from the gas-giant, spreading, consistent with a very large ship having been destroyed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A few other small enemy ships showing, the closest responding to their passing, firing beam weapons. No hits. The destroyer <span class="italic">Bofors</span> passed within a kilo-klick of a vessel of about the same size as it, identified it as a hostile before the other ship had even registered the craft hurtling past and hit and destroyed it with a high-X-ray laser from its phase-modulation collar turret before the hostile had time to react.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Halfway across the system now. Still just the three big targets. There should be hundreds.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The four craft at the trailing end of the advance squadron’s spear-point had time to spare while they nudge-deflected and picked off some of the targets that the point and mid-body ships had identified. They turned long-range sensors on the outer system and beyond, in the general direction of the E-5 Discon, getting a straight-down look along that track which the main fleet had only ever been able to view at a ninety-degree angle.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Drive signatures. Hundreds of them. Most of a thousand ships, all heading for home, taking a slightly acutely angled route that had hidden their drives from the main body of the fleet for the last six or seven days.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Half an hour later, it was like party time. The advance squadron was almost all the way through the system, braking hard to return in a few dozen days, and the small formations of ships between them and the main body of the fleet had been ordered to forget about follow-up high-speed passes and start decelerating at their individual safe maxima.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">All the signs were that the system was almost clear of enemy ships and the Starveling Cult’s main fleet was in high-speed retreat back along roughly the course it had approached on. Even the three big targets were powering up now and heading in the same direction as the decamping invasion force. A few dozen smaller drives lit up as smaller, lighter craft got set to bail out too. There would be some clearing-up to do, and no doubt various mines and automatic munitions to try and keep them occupied while the enemy fleet made its escape, but there would be no main fleet engagement in Ulubis system, no mega-battle.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Their orders were to retake Ulubis system at any cost and hold it. A fast, light force of a dozen or so ships might be sent to harry the tardier fringes of the retreating fleet and provide continuing incentivisation for their speedy withdrawal, but they were specifically not to risk chasing en masse for some decisive battle. They had already achieved victory. They were expressly forbidden from taking the slightest risk of throwing it all away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The command staff were celebrating. Taince lay curled in her pod, listening to her colleagues babbling with happiness and obvious relief. Various people talked to her, gabbing away about how the mere threat of their arrival could turn away a fleet three times the size of theirs, how they wished now they’d been with the advance squadron, just to have seen <span class="italic">some</span> action, dammit, and how they were probably going to get a heroes’ welcome when they got to Ulubis. She tried to respond in kind, mustering expressions of tension released and fears assuaged and all the time pretending to pretend that she’d have preferred a proper fight.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Vice Admiral?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The image of Admiral Kisipt appeared in front of her, automatically displacing all the other images of celebrating crew.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Sir. She tried to pull her thoughts away from the sick feeling inside.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You must be pleased. We won’t have to turn your home system into too much of a battleground.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course, sir. Though there will be mines, booby traps, no doubt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No doubt. And I’m keeping a full sweep alert in operation between here and the system, just in case. Kisipt paused. The old Voehn’s head tipped to one side as he regarded her. - I think it has been very stressful for you, anticipating what might happen when we got to Ulubis, yes?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I suppose so, sir. Taince wondered if he’d already been alerted to her earlier nervousness, if this was a conversation - even a kind of evaluation - inspired by that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm. Well, the place doesn’t look too badly shot up, judging from the advance results. You ought to be able to relax soon. We’ll need you for liaison and ceremonial duties mostly, I should think. The Admiral made a smile. - That will be all right?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course, sir. Thank you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Good. The Admiral made a show of looking around at the other images distributed about his own icon. - Well, I’d better talk to a few more people, calm them down, remind them there’s still a job to be done. As you were, Vice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Sir.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Admiral’s image disappeared. Taince didn’t bring any of the others to the fore, but turned away from the social space altogether for Tacspace.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">What have I become?</span> she thought, staring into the dark volumes of Tacspace, watching and not watching coloured lines move and slowly extend, groups of figures, groups of ships tracing their way through the deep space skies bordering Ulubis system. <span class="italic">I wanted a proper battle. Death and destruction. I wanted death and destruction. I wanted the chance to die, the chance to kill, the chance to die . . .</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She stared into the awful emptiness as people celebrated around her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">What have I become?</span></span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>Fassin felt restless as the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> powered its way through the belts and zones of Nasqueron, heading for the RushWing <span class="italic">Sheumerith</span>, riding high in the clear gas spaces between two haze layers in Band A. The ex-Voehn ship shredded clouds as it sped through the atmosphere, keeping just under the median cloud level. Quercer &amp; Janath amused themselves by taking turns to pilot in real-time and see by how little they could miss shaving the edges of PlungeStems. This involved quite a lot of whooping and the occasional softish collision, making the whole ship shudder.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin left them to it and floated away back through the ship, ending up in the chamber where their interrogation and the fight had taken place. He looked round it, at the dent-seats and restraints, at the scars and burn marks on the floor, ceilings and walls, and could remember nothing about what had happened. He felt frustrated, even depressed. He floated back towards the command space, stopping just before he got there to look inside what appeared to be the commander’s cabin, close to the flight deck.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The cabin was sparsely furnished and decorated. Fassin suspected that it had lost a few bits and pieces to some of the more acquisitive alien-ship enthusiasts back at Quaibrai. He looked at a square on the wall where something had been removed. The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> shook very slightly. A distant whoop sounded from the command space, a couple of open doors and a short corridor away. Fassin experienced a shudder of his own, and a feeling of something like déjà vu, or Swim.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">I was born in a water moon</span>, he thought to himself, knowing he was quoting something or somebody but not knowing what or who.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Another shudder ran through the ship. High-pitched giggles rang from the flight deck.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Zero.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hey! Fassin! Quercer &amp; Janath sent. - Call for you. Patch through?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Who is it? he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No ident.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Human female voice. Hold on, we’ll ask.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Zero, Fassin thought. Zero. It <span class="italic">was</span> a fucking answer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Aun Liss, name given.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Any bells rung?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>The RushWing <span class="italic">Sheumerith</span>, a thin blade across the dun sky, held no sign of Valseir. The <span class="italic">Protreptic</span> went off to bag more PlungeStems, promising to return. Fassin flew the little gascraft wearily along the line of tethered, oblivious, wing-hanging Dwellers, waiting for a sign.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the end, the other gascraft was obvious. He spotted it from a couple of thousand metres away. The other device saw him at the same time and sent,</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No, I’m a warhead. Who are you?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Aun. See you’ve brought a gun.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d taken a Voehn hand-weapon from the <span class="italic">Protreptic</span>, once he’d found an armoury that hadn’t been raided for souvenirs by the ship enthusiasts of Quaibrai. Quercer &amp; Janath hadn’t objected. On the contrary, they’d advised him in rather too much detail on the differing capabilities and skill profiles of the various guns on offer when all he wanted was something robust, reliable and powerful that he could use to defend or kill himself with.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">So in his good manipulator Fassin now toted a chunky device of what Quercer &amp; Janath had termed the CBE persuasion - Crude But Effective.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He made a show of holding the charged weapon in front of his primary sensing band as he approached. - Yes, he sent. - It’s a souvenir.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He drew up by the other machine. It was about the same size and shape as his own, if in rather better condition, and oriented at ninety degrees, the vertical axis longer than the horizontal. It rode inside the cup of still gas behind the open diamond shelter trailing behind the RushWing, near the port limit of the ten-kilometre wing. Wary - unable to be anything else - he noted that the two enclosures on either side of the one holding the other small gascraft were each occupied by large Dwellers who looked rather young to have given themselves up, even temporarily, to a life of high-speed, high-altitude contemplation. The nearest few tether points beyond those on either side were all empty.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Come on in, the other machine sent, moving forward until its nose nestled into the inner surface of the diamond enclosure. He pulled in behind, wobbling in the sudden pool of still gas after the howl of slipstream.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were almost touching. Most of the upper surface of the machine facing him turned transparent, showing somebody who certainly looked like Aun Liss lying nearly fully prone in a high-gee seat. He saw her fight to raise an arm and wave, a grim expression on her face that turned into a grin as she looked out at him. He de-opaqued what he could of his own gascraft’s carapace, though the results weren’t perfect.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin didn’t even try to smile back.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Think you could point that thing away from me? she sent. He saw her grin. - I realise this is the first time I’ve ever said <span class="italic">that</span> to—</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No, he sent back, still pointing the Voehn gun at her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- . . . Okay, she sent, smile vanishing. - So, welcome back. Good trip?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- No. You got a manipulator you can use in that thing?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes. Won’t claim I’m an expert, but . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He moved his own gascraft forward until it was centimetres from hers. - Talk to me the old way.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He saw her frown, then smile uncertainly. - Okay, she sent. - This might be a bit, ah . . . He could see her shifting her gaze to look down at her right forearm, lying squashed on the cradle-arm of the gee-chair. She looked like she always had, and at the same time quite different. Hair dark, not blonde or auburn or white this time. The high gravity and her attempt to look at her arm as she worked the unfamiliar manipulator interface gave her jowls. He was already fairly sure it was Aun, but he was still quite prepared to kill her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The manipulator came out slowly, unsteadily. Fassin kept his own well out of the way, still holding the gun on her. The two big Dwellers on either side hadn’t made any move. The manipulator came forward and touched the hull carapace of his own little gascraft, finger ends spreading awkwardly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">In the end, he saw, she had to close her eyes to do it. The fingers on the abraded, nearly insensitive gascraft’s skin spelled out, . . . SS ( ) . . . SOL ( ) SOTL ( ). He could see her getting frustrated. He watched the expression on her face deepen into a profound, eyes-tightly-closed frown as she struggled to make the manipulator do exactly what she wanted. He felt tears prick his eyes again. Though he could still shoot her, or himself: anybody.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">... SO STL CRZY? she managed at last, and her eyes opened and she flashed a hugely relieved and pleased-with-herself smile at him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He switched the gun off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>They rode together in the still ball of gas behind the cup of diamond, held on a deep curve of line behind the RushWing’s thin blade.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not us. That wasn’t us. Not guilty. It wasn’t even the Starvelings, murdering fucks though they may be.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Then who did do it?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The Mercatoria, Fass. They killed your people.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What? Why?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Because they found out that Sept Bantrabal had kept whatever they were sent that briefed you. They were supposed to junk it from the substrate as soon as it was finished but they didn’t. It wasn’t quite an AI like they sent to the Hierchon, but it had a lot in common. It was a big step along the way to a true AI and it was onward-engineerable. That’s why. The attacks we and the Starvelings were making gave them the cover, but even if the truth got out, it would just reinforce how seriously they took the no-AIs thing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin supposed it made sense. Old Slovius had always been looking for an edge, some advantage over the other Septs. That was what had brought Bantrabal to its position of prominence over the years. It sounded plausible, sounded like something Slovius would do and browbeat his underlings into doing. And certainly he’d put nothing past the Mercatoria.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And how do you know all this? he asked her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He saw her shake her head. - Spies everywhere, Fass, she told him, almost rueful. - We have a lot of friends.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’m sure.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Did he believe her? Well, until further notice.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Beyonders had known about the List, about the Transform. Like, it seemed, a lot of people, they had known long before he had. He’d only discovered what he’d stumbled upon during that long-ago delve when he’d been told along with everybody else by the projection of Admiral Quile in the Hierchon’s palace. By then the Beyonders had long since sent their own fleet to the system Zateki, believing - like the Jeltick who had first deciphered the information he’d retrieved and had understood its significance - that the Transform was there, in the Second Ship. And they’d already met defeat at the hands of the Voehn. Half the fucking galaxy seemed to have been buzzing round Zateki, searching for a ship that wasn’t there, if it even ever had been, and meanwhile he’d known nothing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You could just have asked me to look for it for you, Fassin told her. - I’d have started the search for the Transform in Nasq. centuries ago if you guys had just fucking asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She looked at him for a long time, an expression on her face of . . . he wasn’t sure: sadness, pity, regret, despair?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What? he sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The truth? she asked him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The truth.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Fassin. She shook her head. - We didn’t trust you.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He stared back at her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Fassin told her what he thought he’d discovered, what he believed he’d worked out. She didn’t believe him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You coming with us?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Can I? May I?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course. If you want.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He thought. - Okay, he sent. He thought some more. - Though I’ve one last person to see first.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>When the visitor arrived, Setstyin was water-bathing. This was a new fashion, not unpleasant. His servant announced that Seer Fassin Taak was here to see him. Setstyin felt surprise and elation, and a kind of delicious, if slightly grim, anticipation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Tell Seer Taak I am very delighted indeed to welcome him,’ he told his servant. ‘Ask him to wait in the upper library. Do all you can to make him comfortable. I shall be with him in ten minutes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Fassin! Wonderful to see you! I really can’t tell you! We thought - well, we really feared the worst, I swear. Where have you <span class="italic">been</span>?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin didn’t seem to know what to say. ‘I don’t think you’d believe me if I told you,’ he said quietly, eventually.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little gascraft floated in the middle of the library. The circular space was lined and floored with crystal stacks. Light came from a translucent ceiling and a single great door giving out onto a broad, rail-less balcony.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin’s house was in the city of Aowne, mid-gas in the equatorial zone. Deep orange and yellow clouds swung slowly past the wide window.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You think so?’ Setstyin said. ‘Do feel free to try me. And, please, is there anything I can do? Come, let’s sit.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They rested in a pair of dent-seats with a low table between them. A rather more substantial and grand desk lay just to one side.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, it’s a long story I have for you,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘My favourite kind!’ Setstyin exclaimed, gathering his long robes about him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin took a moment, as if collecting his thoughts. The fellow seemed, Setstyin thought, dulled, a little slow compared to how he’d appeared before.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin told the suhrl something of his adventures since he’d last seen him, aboard the Planetary Protector (Deniable) <span class="italic">Isaut</span>. He also told him a little more of what he’d been doing before, as well, apologising for any hesitations or forgetfulness; he’d been through a lot recently and some memories were still sort of shuffling their way forward into the light again after being lost. He didn’t say exactly what it was he had been told to look for and bring back, and he wasn’t able to tell the Dweller very much that happened after the Voehn attacked the <span class="italic">Velpin</span>, but he went into as much detail as he felt was possible.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I don’t understand,’ the Dweller said. ‘You’re saying you were . . . you were in other stellar systems? You were on the other side of the galaxy? I . . . I just don’t . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I could not have been more sceptical myself,’ Fassin said. ‘I did all the tests I could think of, but I certainly seemed to be in the places the truetwin captain claimed I was in.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They can do wonderful things with fully immersive VR, you know,’ Setstyin said awkwardly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I know. But this was either real or something well beyond even fully immersive virtual reality.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin was silent for a moment. ‘You know - and please, don’t take this ill - you do look rather, ah, beaten up, Fass my boy.’ The Dweller was looking at the various dents and scars that the little gascraft had picked up during its last few months of use. The malfunctioning left manipulator arm hung awkwardly at the flank of the arrowhead, slightly out of true. Fassin felt almost ashamed of the gascraft’s appearance, as though he’d turned up in a rich gentleman’s library in dirty rags.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes,’ he agreed. ‘As I say, I won’t pretend my memory is all it used to be. The gascraft’s storage has suffered and my own brain doesn’t seem to be as sharp as I remember it being.’ He laughed. ‘But I know what I saw, what I felt and heard and tasted. I stood on rocks watching the swell-waves of a salt ocean breaking, and I was really there, Setstyin. I <span class="italic">was</span> there.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller ruffled his sensory mantle and made the tiny up-and-down sigh-motion. ‘Well, I’m sure you believe what you believe, Fassin, and I would always tend to believe you rather than not. However, many other people wouldn’t be so forgiving. I’m not sure it would be a good idea to make too big a fuss about this.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You could be right.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And . . . I mean to say . . . If this wormhole thing is so secret, why were you taken to - or apparently taken to - the far side of the galaxy, or to anywhere . . . anywhere outside Ulubis?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘To prove the myth was real. Some people, some Dwellers, think it’s time for change. They might not know all the details, but they want the truth known. Nobody wants to take responsibility for just <span class="italic">telling</span> a non-Dweller, but some bumpkin might be pushed in the right direction. And that’s me, I suppose; bumpkin number one. <span class="italic">Deniable</span> bumpkin number one.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And this . . . travelcaptain? Who was he again?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘A truetwin.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, I’ve heard they often are. I didn’t realise they even pretended to travel so far afield. What was his - their name?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’ll forgive me if I don’t betray that confidence.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Of course, of course.’ Setstyin seemed to think. ‘So, if there is this, ah, wormhole thing near Nasqueron, who does it belong to? Who controls it? And, it has to be asked, where exactly is it? Aren’t they rather large and obvious, these wormhole ports?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘They can be made quite small. But yes, you’d think people would have noticed them by now.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Well, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And I’d guess they’re operated by a club or fraternity or something like the same sort of organisation that takes care of planetary defence.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hmm. That would be . . . fairly obvious, I suppose.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘That’s why I came to you, Setstyin,’ Fassin said. ‘I wondered if you’d heard anything about this, about a group of Dwellers who used these portals.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Me?’ The Dweller reacted as though surprised, almost shocked. ‘Well, no. I mean, none of this would be the sort of thing I’d normally get involved with. But, this would be quite something, would it not? I mean to say, if it turned out there was this wormhole here all the time. Wouldn’t it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There are stories, myths, about a whole network of them.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This Dweller List?’ Setstyin paused, then stared. ‘Is that what you were looking for all the time?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Not the List, the Transform that was supposed to hold the key to the List,’ Fassin said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘And did you find it?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin was silent for a moment. Setstyin watched the little gascraft make a show of looking around the library. ‘Is this place quite private? I mean, secure?’ Fassin asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I should hope so,’ Setstyin said. ‘Why?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Can we signal, rather than speak, Setstyin?’ Fassin asked. ‘It’s not as easy for me as speaking, these days, so bear with me, but it is more secure.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course, the Dweller sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, I think I might have found the Transform, the human sent carefully.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Really?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- . . . Really.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You will understand if I am a little sceptical.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Only natural.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Where did you find this Transform?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- On the body of that dead Dweller, in the Ythyn Sepulcraft, on the far side of the galaxy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ah-hah. What ever was it doing there?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It was in a sort of safekeep box.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And who would put it there?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I don’t know.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And what did this Transform consist of?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- An equation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- As in mathematics?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That’s right. It looked a bit like what some people had come to expect it to look like - a code and a frequency for a broadcast signal of some sort - but in the end it was just an equation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And this was supposed to unlock the List thing?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- That’s what we were all told.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Hmm. But?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- But, when I solved the equation, guess what?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Oh. Ah, I have no idea. Do tell.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It came out at nothing. Zero. The Transform turned out to be, in effect, a contrived mathematical joke.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin signalled a laugh.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin shared the amusement. - I see. So, if this is what you were sent to look for, you might be said to have succeeded in your mission, though not in the manner you might have wished. Yes?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Those were pretty much my thoughts, too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, at least you missed all the unpleasantness of this invasion your people have suffered. Thinking of you, I’ve been watching the situation. It all looks quite distressing. And still going on. And affecting us, too. There were explosions around Nasqueron just yesterday. Did you see any of them?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I did. I hear there’s a rumour that the invaders might be about to pull out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Possibly our planetary defence people again. There have been the usual denials, of course. Umm, I’m afraid even if I did know more, I couldn’t talk about it. You understand.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Of course. So, Fassin sent. - You don’t know anything about these wormholes? You’ve never heard of them? I just thought, you being so well connected . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- All news to me, Fassin. Possibly some small group might have control of such things, though I find that hard to believe, frankly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Ah, well, Fassin sent. He was silent for a few moments.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Yes? Setstyin sent.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, Fassin replied slowly. - I did have an idea.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- An idea? Indeed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- What if the Transform answer wasn’t a joke?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Not a joke? But it’s zero. What use is that?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You see, Fassin sent, and the little gascraft nudged forward a fraction on the dent-seat, closer still to Setstyin, - I had thought, what use would an equation be, after all this time? How could it tell you anything useful? A frequency and a code to be broadcast on it was the only thing that really made sense; then these wormholes could be hidden anywhere in the named systems and only activate themselves when needed. So the fact it was an equation at all made it kind of pointless even before it was worked out.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I’ll take your word for it, Setstyin told the human. - You are rather losing me here, but it all sounds terribly convincing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And then there was all that absurd twisting and spiralling when I was aboard the ship heading through the wormhole portals. Being cut off from external senses seemed obvious enough, but why the spiralling?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Umm, yes, in the ship. I see.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And just the fact that all of Dweller society does seem like a proper civilisation.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Now you really are losing me, Fass.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And you obviously possess technologies that we still haven’t understood.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Well, we’re like that. Us Dwellers, aren’t we? Oh dear, I think all this is upsetting my balance.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- You see, if the Transform means what it says, what it’s saying is that the adjustment you have to make to each entry on the Dweller List to find out where the wormhole portals are in relation to those original locations named is . . .</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin held the little gascraft’s working arm out, inviting Setstyin to answer.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller ruffled his sensory mantle, which had gone a slightly odd colour. - I’m sorry, Fassin, I feel positively dizzy.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Nothing! Fassin sent. - The adjustment is zero.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Is it? Is it really? I’m sure this is fascinating, really.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- And what was the original List based on, what did it give?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Again, he gave the Dweller a chance to answer, but he didn’t.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- It gave the location of Dweller-inhabited gas-giants! Fassin put a sort of triumphalist joy into the signalled sentence.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I see. I do feel slightly off, Fass. Do you mind if I... ?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Setstyin rose, wobbling slightly, and roted over to his desk. He started opening lockers and drawers, then glanced up. ‘Keep going, keep going,’ he said. ‘I have my medication in here somewhere.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller signalled to his servant while he looked through the drawers, keeping his signal pit below the level of the desk, out of sight of the human in his gascraft.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Was Mr Taak armed in any way?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">After a moment: - No, sir. The house checked automatically, naturally. Aside from his manipulative devices, he is unarmed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- I see. That’s all.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The arrowhead swivelled to keep line-of-sight with the Dweller.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- The List doesn’t need the Transform, Fassin told Setstyin. - All you need to know is that the planets are the location.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Really? Indeed. And how can that be?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The little gascraft rose up into the air above the dent-seat.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">- Because your wormhole portals are inside your planets, Setstyin, Fassin sent calmly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Dweller froze, then opened one last drawer. ‘But that’s ridiculous,’ he said aloud.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Right in the centre,’ Fassin continued, also speaking out loud now. ‘Probably of every single gas-giant you guys inhabit. There were only - what? - two million when the List was drawn up, that right? But that was long ago, and it was a historical document even then. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to hear you’d connected up every last Dweller planet by now.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m sorry, Fassin,’ Setstyin said. ‘You wouldn’t convince a child with this. Everybody knows you need a flat region of space to make a wormhole portal work.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, that’s the beauty of it. The very centre of a planet <span class="italic">is</span> flat,’ Fassin said. ‘Right in the very centre of a planet, of any free-floating body - sun, rock, gas-giant, anything - you’re being pulled equally in all directions. It’s just like being in orbit round a world and feeling weightless. The only problem, of course, is keeping a volume of space open in the core of a planet or a sun or whatever in the first place. The pressure is colossal, almost beyond belief, especially in a gas-giant the size of Nasq., but in the end it’s just engineering. Hey, you guys have had ten billion years to get good at that sort of stuff. Anything that isn’t impossible you learned to do easily when the galaxy was a quarter of the age it is now.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So you don’t need to position portals in space where anybody could see them or use them or attack them, you don’t even need to leave your own planet to access them, you just head for some well-hidden shaft that leads you down to the very centre of the world. Maybe at the poles. That would be an obvious kind of place. And if you’ve got somebody aboard your ship who might be keeping track of where you’re going somehow, you just throw in all these crazy spirals and flash some screenage of space into wherever you’re keeping them, so they never can tell they’ve gone down, not up, and have sunk into the core, not flown out into space.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, here we are,’ Setstyin said, and pulled out a large handgun. Suddenly perfectly steady, he aimed and fired before the little gascraft could react.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The beams tore the arrowhead apart, slamming through it and sending it whirling back against a stack of library crystals and then somersaulting over and over as Setstyin kept firing the gun, spreading fire and scattering wreckage all over the library floor. Wildly spinning pieces of debris were sent shrapnelling across the glittering stacks, cracking spines and smashing crystal pages to powder. What was left of the little craft crashed into the windows by the balcony, shattering the diamond as though it was sugar glass. Setstyin stopped firing.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Debris pattered down. Smoke drifted, gradually sucked towards the shattered window.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The big Dweller roted carefully over to the broken window, keeping the gun trained on the smoking remains of the little craft as he approached.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir?’ his servant called over the house intercom. ‘Sir, are you all right? I thought I heard—’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fine,’ Setstyin called, not shifting his attention from the wreckage as he drew closer. ‘I’m fine. Be some cleaning up to do in due course, but I’m fine. Leave me, now.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A warm breeze ruffled his robes as Setstyin floated out of the window and drew up almost on top of the guttering wreck. He prodded the ruined gascraft with the muzzle of the gun. He prised part of the craft’s upper shell away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He peered inside.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fucker!’ he screamed, and whirled back into the library, tearing through the gas to the desk. ‘Desk! SecComms, <span class="italic">now</span>!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/>Aun Liss watched the man as his little craft, his second skin, was destroyed.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin winced just the once, twitching as though pained.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Aun thought he did not look well. His body was thin inside the borrowed fatigues and he was trembling slightly but continually. His face looked much older than it had, pinched and drawn, eyes sunken and surrounded with darkness. His hair, looking crinkled and thin, had grown a little while he’d been inside the gascraft. His eyes and the edges of his ears and nostrils, plus the corners of his mouth, were red from the effects of coming out of the shock-gel - and having the gillfluid come out of him - after all this time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He turned to look at her. She was glad to see there was a twinkle in his eye, despite it all. ‘So. Still think I’m crazy?’ he asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She smiled. ‘Pretty much.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They sat in the bright, if cramped, command space of the <span class="italic">Ecophobian</span>, a Beyonder shockcraft, a medium-weight warship half a light second out from Nasqueron, linked to the now-defunct gascraft via a twin of the eyeball-sized microsat which had been exactly where it was supposed to be a day earlier, when Fassin had pinged it from the high platform in Quaibrai.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were, amazingly, still receiving basic telemetry from the shattered gascraft, though no sensory content. The machine had been very thoroughly blasted.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">On a side-screen, they had a freeze of the last visual that the little gascraft had sent: Setstyin levelling a sizeable handgun straight at the camera, a tiny sparkle of light just starting in the very centre of the weapon’s dark barrel. Fassin nodded at the image. ‘I hasten to add that that does not constitute standard Dweller hospitality.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’d guessed. Sure it wasn’t because you just wouldn’t shut up?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I’m serious.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You’re serious? What do you call the guy with the big fuck-off gun?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Aun,’ Fassin said, sounding tired now. ‘Do you believe me?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She hesitated, shrugged. ‘I’m with your belligerent friend; I believe you believe.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The gascraft telemetry cut off.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The Chief Remotes Officer leaned in, manipulating holos above one of the displays. ‘That wasn’t the gascraft totalling,’ she told them, ‘that was the microsat getting fried. Fast work. Suggest hightail promptly.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hold on to your hats,’ the captain said. ‘Sit well back.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were thrown, pressed, then rammed back into their seats as the ship accelerated, the command officers shifting to control by induction rather than physical manipulation. The whole gimballed command sphere swung to keep the gee-forces pressing on their chests.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘<span class="italic">Were</span> you serious, Mr Taak?’ the captain asked, her voice strained against the clamping power of the acceleration.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yuh,’ was the best Fassin could manage.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So there’s a secret network of ancient Dweller wormholes linking - what? - every Dweller gas-giant?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Fassin took the deepest breath he could and forced out, ‘That’s the idea.’ Another breath. ‘You send all we . . . got from the . . . gascraft to . . . your high command?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The captain managed to laugh. ‘Such as they are, yes.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Shit,’ said the Defence Officer, his voice strained. ‘Lock on.’ They heard him breathing hard. ‘It’s fast! Can’t outrun. In fourteen!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Fire everything,’ the captain said crisply. ‘Ready Detach Command. We’ll risk adrifting, hope the <span class="italic">Impavid</span>’s local.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Need to yaw before the Detach or we’ll be hit by the debris spray,’ the Tactics Officer said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Copy,’ the captain said. ‘Shame. Always liked this ship.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ship wheeled wildly, Fassin blacked out and never felt the explosive detach.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The joltship <span class="italic">Impavid</span> picked the command sphere up three days later.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre4"> <br class="calibre3"/> <br class="calibre3"/>‘Taince,’ Saluus Kehar said. He grinned. ‘Hey. So, so good to see you again.’ He came up to her and put his arms round her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince Yarabokin had succeeded in producing a smile. She’d chosen an old-fashioned formal cap as part of her uniform and so had the unspoken excuse that she needed to keep this clamped between her elbow and her side for not being able to hug him back with any great enthusiasm. Sal didn’t seem to notice anyway. He pulled away, looked at her.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Been a while, Taince. Glad you made it back.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good to be back,’ Taince said.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were in a hangar in the Guard Security Holding Facility Axle 7, a triple-wheeled habitat orbiting ’glantine. Saluus had been held there for the past couple of months while the authorities had decided whether they really believed him about having been kidnapped rather than having run away or even turned traitor.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">He’d consented to and undergone dozens of brain scans - more than enough to put the matter beyond any doubt in an ordinary case, and of course he had connections and friends in high places who would normally have been only too happy to have discreet words in probably quite receptive ears. But there had been a feeling that this was an exceptional matter, that Sal was rich enough to have afforded technologies or techniques that would fool the brain scans, that the Starvelings themselves might have been able to implant convincing false memories, and - anyway - such a fuss had been made at the time when Saluus had, seemingly, gone over to the invading forces that to let him meekly out just because it looked like he was blameless somehow didn’t seem right.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When Saluus had disappeared, apparently turning traitor, there had been strikes and attacks on Kehar family and commercial property and he’d been denounced by every part of the Ulubine Mercatoria in terms that owed as much to finally having something understandable to hit out at as to any moral indignation. People who had called Sal a friend and been regular guests at many of his family homes had decided that they owed it to the popular mood and their intense personal sense of betrayal - not to mention their future social standing and careers - to compete in out-vituperating each other in their condemnation of his odious perfidy. The calumnies heaped upon Sal’s absent head had amounted to a thesaurus of despite, an entire dictionary of bile. In the end he was kept incarcerated as much for his own safety as for anything else.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">When the Starveling forces left and the Summed Fleet arrived, the general feeling of relief and euphoria pervading the Ulubis system meant that news of Sal’s shocking innocence traded rather better on the floor of the public’s perception, and it could be announced that he was to be released in due course. Most people chose to recant their earlier expressions of hatred and condemnation, though it was still felt best for all concerned if Sal’s return to public life and rehabilitation was gradual rather than abrupt.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince had volunteered - pulled rank, indeed - to pilot Sal from the Holding Facility back to the original Kehar family home on ’glantine.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">A Guard-major got Taince to sign Sal out of custody.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sal watched her signature on the pad. ‘That’s my freedom you’re writing there, Vice Admiral,’ he told her. He was wearing his own clothes, looking slim and casual and bright.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Glad to be of service,’ she told him, then looked at the Guards officer. ‘Is that us, Guard-major?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, ma’am.’ He turned to Saluus. ‘You are free to go, Mr Kehar.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Saluus reached out and shook the Guard-major’s hand. ‘Med, thanks for everything.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Been a pleasure, sir.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘No clothes or anything?’ Taince asked, looking at his empty hands.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sal shook his head. ‘Came with nothing, taking nothing away. No baggage.’ He flashed a smile.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She tipped her head. ‘Pretty good at our age.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They walked to the small cutter squatting on the shallow curve of the hangar floor. ‘I really appreciate this, Taince,’ he told her. ‘I mean I <span class="italic">really</span> do. You didn’t have to do this.’ She smiled. His gaze flicked over her insignia. ‘It is okay to call you Taince, isn’t it? I mean, I’ll call you Vice Admiral if you like . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Taince is fine, Sal. After you.’ She showed him up into the little cutter’s tandem cockpit, settling him into the seat in front of and below hers. She fitted herself into the pilot’s seat, clipping on a light flight collar and waking the small craft’s systems. The Facility’s flight control cleared them to leave.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘So you’re, what? System Liaison Chief?’ Sal asked over his shoulder as they were trundled under a door into a sizeable airlock.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes, well, it’s pretty much all ceremonial,’ she told him. The door behind them closed, the lights in the lock dimmed. ‘Receptions, dinners, tours, addresses, you know the sort of thing.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sounds like you’re just loving every minute.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I suppose somebody has to do it. Serves me right for being Ulubine.’ Pumps thrummed, a rush of air and a deep hum at first, then after a while just the hum, sounding through the fabric of the cutter. ‘No real fighting to do, anyway. Just clean-up stuff. I’m not missing much.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Any news on Fassin?’ Sal asked. ‘Last I heard they thought he might be alive again. If you know what I mean.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The outer door opened silently to the stars and a great silvery-fawn slice of ’glantine.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Just give me a minute or two here, will you?’ Taince asked. ‘Been a little while since I did this . . .’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Hey, take as long as you need.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The cutter edged its way out of the lock, stowed its gear, rolled very slowly and drifted away on little whisper bursts of gas, heading towards the atmosphere.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Yes. Fassin,’ Taince said. ‘Well, they’re still looking for him.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I heard he’d been lost in Nasqueron and then reappeared.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘There have been rumours. There were always rumours. If you believed them, he’s been all over Nasqueron for the last half-year, never left, or been in the Oort cloud for the last few months and just returned, or even wilder stuff. Plus he’s been declared definitely dead at least three times. Whatever the truth is, he’s still not here to tell it himself.’ Taince rotated the cutter, lining it up for entry.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘You think he is dead?’ Sal asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Let’s just say it’s odd that he hasn’t made himself known by now, if he is still around.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They met the atmosphere a little later, pressed against the seat restraints, a pink glow building then fading around the canopy, the small ship whistling in across a sequence of thin clouds, deserts and shallow seas, hills, scarps, lakes and low mountains.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Taking the scenic route, Taince?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She gave a small laugh. ‘Suppose I’m just a sentimentalist at heart, Sal.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Good to see the old place again,’ Sal said. She watched him lean to one side, looking down. ‘Is that Pirri down there?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She looked, checked the nav. ‘Yes, that’s Pirrintipiti.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Looks like it always did. Thought it might have grown a bit more.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘While since you’ve been home, Sal?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Oh, too long, too long. Kept meaning to, but, you know. Must be ten or twelve years. Maybe more. Feels more.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They were high over the edges of the thin polar-plateau ice cap, crossing into darkness, falling all the time. They could see stars again.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She saw him looking up and around. ‘You forget how beautiful it is, eh?’ Sal asked.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Sometimes,’ Taince said. ‘Easy enough thing to do.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The glow in the sky faded around them. She watched the canopy up the brightness, exaggerating the incoming light until they could see the starlight on the North Waste Land, the great long streaks of coloured sands and outcrop rocks, silvery ghosts, coming closer all the time.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah, right,’ Sal said quietly.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She tapped a few display icons, dimming the screens.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Thought we’d take a pass,’ she said. ‘Hope you don’t mind.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Old times’ sake.’ He sounded thoughtful, even resigned. ‘Well, why not?’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince checked the nav again, lined the craft up and cut its speed a little. A light was blinking urgently on one of the displays. She turned that one off too.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘I certainly haven’t been back here since that night,’ Sal said. She thought he sounded sad now. Perhaps regretful. Perhaps not.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">The ruined ship showed up ahead, a little off to the right. Taince started the cutter on a long starboard curve, levelling out as she did so.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Sal looked side-down at the desert, rushing past seventy metres below as they banked. ‘Wow,’ he said. ‘Quicker than that flier I borrowed from Dad.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘One of your own ships, Sal,’ she told him.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘This little thing?’ He laughed. ‘Didn’t realise we made anything this small.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘It’s old.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Ah. One of Dad’s. More money in the big stuff.’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">They zapped past the great dark hulk. Its exposed ribs clawed at the sky.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Woo-hoo!’ Sal shouted as the black wall of hull slid past twenty metres away.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Taince zoomed, looped and rolled, levelling out again, approaching the wrecked alien ship once more for an even nearer approach.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">‘Who-hoh-<span class="italic">hoh</span>!’ Sal said, seeing how low and close Taince was taking the cutter this time. Taince rolled the craft so that they were upside down. ‘Sheeit! Wow! Taince! Yee-ha!’</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Right to the end she hadn’t known if she’d actually do it or not. She didn’t really know the truth of what had happened, after all. She only had her suspicions. She could, despite everything, just be plain wrong. It wouldn’t be the first time somebody had taken the law into their own hands and been proved to be hopelessly wrong, once all the facts were known. Fuck, that was what justice was supposed to be all about, that was why you had laws and everything that went with them, that was one of the things that made a society a society.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But still. She did know. She was quite sure. It was his time. And if she was wrong, well, Sal had had his share. It wasn’t like killing a child, or a young woman with her life before her. It was still killing, still wrong, but there were gradations in all things, even circles in hell. And, frankly - right or wrong - at least she’d never know.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">It was her time. She knew that.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She’d really thought there would be tears, but they stayed away. How strange not to know oneself, after so long, at such an extremity, and so close to the end.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">What else? Well, she’d thought of telling him, of confronting him, of bringing it all back up again, of listening to him rage at or plead with or scream at her. That had been something she’d rehearsed a lot, that had been something she’d thought through time after time after time as she’d played and replayed this scene in her head over the years and decades and centuries, taking both her part and his, trying to imagine what he’d say, how he’d try to explain it, how he’d imply she was mad or mistaken.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Ultimately Taince had just got bored with it. She’d heard it all before. There was nothing more to say.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">She was taking a man’s life on circumstantial evidence, on a hunch. She ought to give him the chance to appeal. She ought at least to allow him to know it was about to happen.</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<div class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">But then, why?</span></div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
