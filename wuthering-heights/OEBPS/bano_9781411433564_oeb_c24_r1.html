<div class="tx1"><b>A</b>t the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused. She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn&#8217;t you better lie down now? You&#8217;ll be sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;No, no, dear, I&#8217;m not tired,&#8217; I returned, continually.</div>
<div class="tx">Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching, and&#8212;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Ellen, I&#8217;m tired.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Give over then and talk,&#8217; I answered.</div>
<div class="tx">That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep; judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs in the dark. No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below. The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar&#8217;s door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the window.</div>
<div class="tx">The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and reappeared presently, leading Miss&#8217;s pony; and there she was, just dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;My dear Miss Catherine,&#8217; I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, &#8216;where have you been riding out at this hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where have you been? Speak!&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;To the bottom of the park,&#8217; she stammered. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t tell a tale.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;And nowhere else?&#8217; I demanded.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;No,&#8217; was the muttered reply.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Oh, Catherine!&#8217; I cried, sorrowfully. &#8216;You know you have been doing wrong, or you wouldn&#8217;t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That does grieve me. I&#8217;d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a deliberate lie.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my neck.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Well, Ellen, I&#8217;m so afraid of you being angry,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Promise not to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced&#8212;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I&#8217;ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I&#8217;ve never missed going a day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn&#8217;t scold <i>him</i> either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was refas tening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn&#8217;t come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that satisfied him better.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs&#8212;robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards&#8212;we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn&#8217;t repeat that, because you would call it silly.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of heaven&#8217;s happiness: mine was rocking in a  rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells;<a id="Ref-FTN-149" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-149"><sup>es</sup></a> but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we&#8217;d have a game at blindman&#8217;s-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn&#8217;t: there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores<a id="Ref-FTN-150" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-150"><sup>et</sup></a> and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran<a id="Ref-FTN-151" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-151"><sup>eu</sup></a> came out of H., and Linton didn&#8217;t like it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his good humor: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs&#8212;<i>your</i> songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till morning.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny&#8217;s neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do mitch<a id="Ref-FTN-152" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-152"><sup>ev</sup></a> hurt if it did;&#8221; and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: &#8220;Miss Catherine! I can read yon, now.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Pray let us hear you&#8212;you <i>are</i>  grown clever!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name&#8212;&#8220;Hare ton Earnshaw.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;And the figures?&#8221; I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a dead halt.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;I cannot tell them yet,&#8221; he answered.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Oh, you dunce!&#8221; I said, laughing heartily at his failure.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He reddened&#8212;I saw that by the moonlight&#8212;dropped his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn&#8217;t think the same.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!&#8217; I interrupted. &#8216;I shall not scold, but I don&#8217;t like your conduct there. If you had remem  bered that Hareton was your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had <i>you</i> been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I&#8217;m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Well, Ellen, you won&#8217;t cry about it, will you?&#8217; she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness. &#8216;But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C<a id="Ref-FTN-153" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-153"><sup>ew</sup></a> to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;m ill to-night, Catherine, love,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and you must have all the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn&#8217;t break your word, and I&#8217;ll make you promise again, before you go.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I knew now that I mustn&#8217;t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Get to thy own room!&#8221; he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and furious. &#8220;Take her there if she comes to see thee: thou shalln&#8217;t keep me out of this. Begone wi&#8217; ye both!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;I wer sure he&#8217;d sarve ye out!<a id="Ref-FTN-154" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-154"><sup>ex</sup></a> He&#8217;s a grand lad! He&#8217;s getten t&#8217; raight sperrit in him! <i>He</i> knaws&#8212;ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t&#8217; maister yonder&#8212;Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift<a id="Ref-FTN-155" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-155"><sup>ey</sup></a> properly! Ech, ech, ech!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Where must we go?&#8221; I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch&#8217;s mockery.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no! he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;If you don&#8217;t let me in, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8212;If you don&#8217;t let me in, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; he rather shrieked than said. &#8220;Devil! devil!&#8212;I&#8217;ll kill you&#8212;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Thear, that&#8217;s t&#8217; father!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s father! We&#8217;ve allas summut o&#8217; either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad&#8212;dunnut be &#8217;feard&#8212;he cannot get at thee!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I took hold of Linton&#8217;s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired what there was to do? I hadn&#8217;t breath to explain; dragging her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn&#8217;t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed that he had killed Linton, and I <i>would</i> enter. Joseph locked the door, and declared I should do &#8220;no sich stuff,&#8221; and asked me whether I were &#8220;bahn<a id="Ref-FTN-156" href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-156"><sup>ez</sup></a> to be as mad as him.&#8221; I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn&#8217;t do with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me &#8220;wisht,&#8221; and denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side, and checked Minny and took hold of me.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Miss Catherine, I&#8217;m ill grieved,&#8221; he began, &#8220;but it&#8217;s rayther too bad&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my senses.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I didn&#8217;t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn&#8217;t go to Wuthering Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the third day I took courage: at least, I couldn&#8217;t bear longer suspense, and stole off once more. I went at five o&#8217;clock, and walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton&#8217;s room, unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah received me, and saying &#8220;the lad was mending nicely,&#8221; showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a faint &#8220;Catherine!&#8221; He did not reckon on being answered so:  but I wouldn&#8217;t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed. It <i>had</i> appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong to refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying to conceal my presence.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Young master is in the house,&#8221; said Zillah, as she saw me making for the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true&#8212;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;As you don&#8217;t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he mustn&#8217;t invent any more falsehoods on the subject.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;&#8220;Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You are so much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody! I <i>am</i> worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if you choose, you  <i>may</i> say good-bye: you&#8217;ll get rid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn&#8217;t, and cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent it till I die!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not entirely for sorrow; yet I <i>was</i> sorry Linton had  that distorted nature. He&#8217;ll never let his friends be at ease, and he&#8217;ll never be at ease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night; because his father returned the day after.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I&#8217;ve learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I can&#8217;t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff&#8217;s lecture by entering and telling him so. He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of the matter. Since then, I&#8217;ve told Linton he must whisper his bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can&#8217;t be prevented from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas, if you&#8217;ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of none. You&#8217;ll not tell, will you? It will be very heartless, if you do.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8216;I&#8217;ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;It requires some study; and so I&#8217;ll leave you to your rest, and go think it over.&#8217;</div>
<div class="tx">I thought it over aloud, in my master&#8217;s presence; walking straight from her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew&#8217;s disposition and state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.</div>
