BIOGRAPHY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
<div class="bmtx1">Beginning with Elizabeth Gaskell&#8217;s <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&#235;</i>  (1857), innumerable accounts of the lives and the world of the Bront&#235;s have been published&#8212;so many that the family has acquired legendary status. Myths about the Bront&#235;s have also circulated widely, and much recent scholarship has been devoted to sorting fact from fiction. The two biographies noted below are even-handed studies, while the collection of letters enables the Bront&#235;s to speak in their own voices. Emily&#8217;s poetry, which stands on its own merit, can also be read in relation to <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Although details concerning the inception and the production of the novel are scant, several accounts have been written, including the one cited below.</div>

CRITICISM AND GUIDES</h1>
