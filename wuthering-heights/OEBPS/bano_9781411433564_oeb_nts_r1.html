M. Heger, the director of the Pensionnat Heger in Brussels, where Emily and Charlotte studied in 1842, characterized Emily as having &#8220; &#8216;a head for logic, and a capability of argument, unusual in a man, and rare indeed in a woman&#8217; &#8221; (quoted in Barker, <i>The Bront&#235;s</i>, p. 392; see &#8220;For Further Reading&#8221;).</div><div class="lh">PREFACE</div>

Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s <i>Waverly; or, &#8217;Tis Sixty Years Since</i> (1814) provides one of the most popular precedents for this practice, and the work of Scott, widely read by the Bront&#235; family, was influential in shaping Emily&#8217;s imagination.<div class="bmtx">While <i>Wuthering Heights</i> begins in 1801 with Lockwood&#8217;s account, the ensuing narrative that is framed within his account details events that occurred in the thirty years from 1771 to the present, which encompasses the years 1801 and 1802, and concludes by looking forward to 1803. Within the complex narrative and temporal structure of the novel, references to time abound, enabling readers to fix the dates of the action with some specificity. The genealogy of the Earnshaw and Linton families provided in this edition of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> offers a starting point for understanding the chronology of events in the novel.</div>

Daughters were unlikely to be named heirs to estates since, upon marriage, they relinquished their property to their husbands. Nelly&#8217;s subsequent remark concerning Mr. Linton&#8217;s estate is somewhat ambiguous, since it suggests that he may have taken the unusual step of &#8220;securing his estate&#8221; to Isabella, rather than to Edgar. If that were the case, however, Heathcliff would already have gained possession of Thrushcross Grange at this point in the narrative and not much later, when Lockwood becomes his tenant. At the moment of Catherine&#8217;s birth, though, the crucial point is that because Edgar&#8217;s child is a girl, on his death the estate will be passed on to the closest male relative.</div><div class="end"><a href="bano_9781411433564_oeb_c16_r1.html#Ref-en60" id="en60">2</a>   (p. 165) <i>&#8220;drive me mad!&#8221;:</i> Heathcliff&#8217;s longing for Catherine recalls Manfred&#8217;s longing for the dead Astarte in Lord Byron&#8217;s  <i>Manfred</i> (1817), a tragedy in verse:<div class="abmtx1"><div class="bmtx1">Speak to me! though it be in wrath;&#8212;but say&#8212;<br></br>I reck not what&#8212;but let me hear thee once&#8212;<br></br>This once&#8212;once more!
