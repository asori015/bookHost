<div class="fmtx1">A perfect misanthropist&#8217;s heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. (page 3)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">He&#8217;ll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. (page 6)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;I&#8217;m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.&#8217; (page 28)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.&#8217; (page 56)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;I&#8217;ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they&#8217;ve gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.&#8217; (page 79)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;Heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.&#8217; (page 80)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;He&#8217;s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.&#8217; (page 80)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn&#8217;t love as much in eighty years as I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him.&#8217; (page 148)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.&#8217; (page 151)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">I don&#8217;t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter&#8212;the Eternity they have entered&#8212;where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its fulness. (page 163)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;And I pray one prayer&#8212;I repeat it till my tongue stiffens&#8212;Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you&#8212;haunt me, then! The murdered <i>do</i> haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts <i>have</i> wandered on earth. Be with me always&#8212;take any form&#8212;drive me mad! only <i>do</i> not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I <i>cannot</i> live without my life! I <i>cannot</i> live without my soul!&#8217; (page 165)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">&#8216;He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. &#8217; (page 239)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="fmtx1">I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
