<div class="bmtx">In spite of much power and cleverness; in spite of its truth to life in the remote nooks and corners of England, &#8216;Wuther ing Heights&#8217; is a disagreeable story. The Bells seem to affect painful and exceptional subjects:&#8212;the misdeeds and oppressions of tyranny&#8212;the eccentricities of &#8220;woman&#8217;s fantasy.&#8221; They do not turn away from dwelling upon those physical acts of cruelty which we know to have their warrant in the real annals of crime and suffering,&#8212;but the contemplation of which true taste rejects. The brutal master of the lonely house on &#8220;Wuthering Heights&#8221;&#8212;a prison which might be pictured from life&#8212;has doubtless had his prototype in those ungenial and remote districts where human beings, like the trees, grow gnarled and dwarfed and distorted by inclement climate; but he might have been indicated with far fewer touches, in place of so entirely filling the canvas that there is hardly a scene untainted by his presence.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from an unsigned review in the <i>Athenaeum</i>  (December 25, 1847)</div>
<div class="bmtx1"><b>Atlas</b></div>
<div class="bmtx"><i>Wuthering Heights</i> is a strange, inartistic story. There are evidences in every chapter of a sort of rugged power&#8212;an unconscious strength&#8212;which the possessor seems never to think of turning to the best advantage. The general effect is inexpress ibly painful. We know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity. <i>Jane Eyre</i> is a book which affects the reader to tears; it touches the most hidden sources of emotion.  <i>Wuthering Heights</i> casts a gloom over the mind not easily to be dispelled.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;January 1848</div>

<div class="bmtx">The truth is, that the whole firm of Bell &amp; Co. seem to have a sense of the depravity of human nature peculiarly their own. It is the yahoo, not the demon, that they select for representation; their Pandemonium is of mud rather than fire.</div>
<div class="bmtx">This is especially the case with Acton Bell, the author of  <i>Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, and, if we mistake not, of certain offensive but powerful portions of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Acton, when left altogether to his own imaginations, seems to take a morose satisfaction in developing a full and complete science of human brutality. In <i>Wuthering Heights</i> he has succeeded in reaching the summit of this laudable ambition. He appears to think that spiritual wickedness is a combination of animal ferocities, and has accordingly made a compendium of the most striking qualities of tiger, wolf, cur, and wild-cat, in the hope of framing out of such elements a suitable brute-demon to serve as the hero of his novel. [Heathcliff] is a deformed monster, whom the Mephistopheles of Goethe would have nothing to say to, whom the Satan of Milton would consider as an object of simple disgust, and to whom Dante would hesitate in awarding the honour of a place among those whom he has consigned to the burning pitch. This epitome of brutality, disavowed by man and devil, Mr. Acton Bell attempts in two whole volumes to delineate, and certainly he is to be congratulated on his success. As he is a man of uncommon talents,  it is needless to say that it is to his subject and his dogged manner of handling it that we are to refer the burst of dislike with which the novel was received. His mode of delineating a bad character is to narrate every offensive act and repeat every vile expression which are characteristic. Hence, in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, he details all the ingenuities of animal malignity, and exhausts the whole rhetoric of stupid blasphemy, in order that there may be no mistake as to the kind of person he intends to hold up to the popular gaze. Like all spendthrifts of malice and profanity, however, he overdoes the business. Though he scatters oaths as plentifully as sentimental writers do interjections, the comparative parsimony of the great novelists in this respect is productive of infinitely more effect. It must be confessed that this coarseness, though the prominent, is not the only characteristic of the writer. His attempt at originality does not stop with the conception of [Heathcliff], but he aims further to exhibit the action of the sentiment of love on the nature of the being whom his morbid imagination has created. This is by far the ablest and most subtile portion of his labours, and indicates that strong hold upon the elements of character, and that decision of touch in the delineation of the most evanescent qualities of emotion, which distinguish the mind of the whole family. For all practical purposes, however, the power evinced in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is power thrown away. Nightmares and dreams, through which devils dance and wolves howl, make bad novels.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from an unsigned review in the <i>North American Review</i>  (October 1848)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="bmtx1"><b>Sydney Dobell</b></div>
<div class="bmtx">We look upon [<i>Wuthering Heights</i>] as the flight of an impatient fancy fluttering in the very exultation of young wings; sometimes beating against its solitary bars, but turning, rather to exhaust, in a circumscribed space, the energy and agility which it may not yet spend in the heavens&#8212;a youthful story, written for oneself in solitude, and thrown aside till other successes recall the eyes to it in hope. . . .</div>
<div class="bmtx">One looks back at the whole story as to a world of brilliant  figures in an atmosphere of mist; shapes that come out upon the eye, and burn their colours into the brain, and depart into the enveloping fog. It is the unformed writing of a giant&#8217;s hand: the &#8216;large utterance&#8217; of a baby god. In the sprawling of the infant Hercules, however, there must have been attitudes from which the statuary might model. In the early efforts of unusual genius, there are not seldom unconscious felicities which maturer years may look back upon with envy. The child&#8217;s hand wanders over the strings. It cannot combine them in the chords and melodies of manhood; but its separate notes are perfect in themselves, and perhaps sound all the sweeter for the &#198;olian discords from which they come.</div>
<div class="bmtx">We repeat, that there are passages in this book of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> of which any novelist, past or present, might be proud. Open the first volume at the fourteenth page, and read to the sixty-first. There are few things in modern prose to surpass these pages for native power. We cannot praise too warmly the brave simplicity, the unaffected air of intense belief, the admirable combination of extreme likelihood with the rarest originality, the nice provision of the possible even in the highest effects of the supernatural, the easy strength and instinct of keeping with which the accessory circumstances are grouped, the exquisite but unconscious art with which the chiaroscuro of the whole is managed, and the ungenial frigidity of place, time, weather, and persons, is made to heighten the unspeakable pathos of one ungovernable outburst.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from an unsigned review in the <i>Palladium</i>  (September 1850)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="bmtx1"><b>George Henry Lewes</b></div>
<div class="bmtx">Curious enough it is to read <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men&#8212;turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing these books from a  sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! . . .</div>
<div class="bmtx">The power, indeed, is wonderful. Heathcliff, devil though he be, is drawn with a sort of dusky splendour which fascinates, and we feel the truth of his burning and impassioned love for Catherine, and of her inextinguishable love for him. It was a happy thought to make her love the kind, weak, elegant Edgar, and yet without lessening her passion for Heathcliff. Edgar appeals to her love of refinement, and goodness, and culture; Heathcliff clutches her soul in his passionate embrace. Edgar is the husband she has chosen, the man who alone is fit to call her wife; but although she is ashamed of her early playmate she loves him with a passionate abandonment which sets culture, education, the world, at defiance. It is in the treatment of this subject that Ellis Bell shows real mastery, and it shows more genius, in the highest sense of the word, than you will find in a thousand novels.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from the <i>Leader</i> (December 28, 1850)</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="bmtx1"><b>George Barnett Smith</b></div>
<div class="bmtx">Emily Bront&#235;&#8212;for it is now time that we should say something of the two other persons in this remarkable trio&#8212;was, in certain respects, the most extraordinary of the three sisters. She has this distinction at any rate, that she has written a book which stands as completely alone in the language as does the  <i>Paradise Lost</i> or the <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>. This of itself, setting aside subject and construction, is no mean eminence. . . .</div>
<div class="bmtx"><i>Wuthering Heights</i>, the principal work she has left behind her, shows a massive strength which is of the rarest description. Its power is absolutely Titanic: from the first page to the last it reads like the intellectual throes of a giant. It is fearful, it is true, and perhaps one of the most unpleasant books ever written: but we stand in amaze at the almost incredible fact that it was written by a slim country girl who would have passed in a crowd as an insignificant person, and who had had little or no experience of the ways of the world.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from <i>Poets and Novelists</i> (1875)</div>
<div class="bmtx1"><i><b>Atlantic Monthly</b></i></div>
<div class="bmtx">Emily Bront&#235; seems to have had but three ideas, but these three were universal and essential: life, the life of nature and of man, in their deep kinship and possible ultimate identity; love, the primeval instinct which draws man and woman together, to the end that life may be perpetuated; and death, the inexorable arrest and seeming end, both of life and love. No slighter or more transitory thoughts than these can detain her for a moment. A short cut across the bleak, spiritual wilderness into which she was born has led her to the very sources of being, and into these she peers, helplessly, of course, but with what imperious inquisition, what virginal audacity! With those final secular mysteries, which have baffled the stoutest inquiries of all ages, she wrestles such a fall as reminds one of the mythical duels of the maiden Brynhild.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;November 1887</div>
<div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="bmtx1"><b>William Dean Howells</b></div>
<div class="bmtx">A weird malevolence broods over the gloomy drama, and through all plays a force truly demoniacal, with scarcely the relief of a moment&#8217;s kindliness. The facts are simply conceived, and stated without shadow of apology or extenuation; and the imagination from which they sprang cannot adequately be called morbid, for it deals with the brute motives employed without a taint of sickly subjectiveness. The author remains throughout superior to her material; her creations have all a distinct projection, and in this, Emily Bront&#235; shows herself a greater talent than Charlotte, who is never quite detached from her heroine, but is always trammeled in sympathy with Jane Eyre, with whom she is united by ties of a like vocation and experience, as governess. You feel that she is present in all Jane&#8217;s sufferings, small and great, if not in her raptures; but Emily Bront&#235; keeps as sternly aloof from both her Catherines as from Heathcliff himself. She bequeathed the world at her early death a single book of as singular power as any in fiction; and proved herself, in spite of its defective technique, a great artist, of as realistic motive and ideal as any who have followed her.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazaar</i> (December 29, 1900)</div>
<div class="bmtx1"><b>Virginia Woolf</b></div>
<div class="bmtx">The <i>Life [of Charlotte Bront&#235;</i>], by Mrs. Gaskell, gives you the impression that Haworth and the Bront&#235;s are somehow inextricably mixed. Haworth expresses the Bront&#235;s; the Bront&#235;s express Haworth; they fit like a snail to its shell. How far surroundings radically affect people&#8217;s minds, it is not for me to ask: superficially, the influence is great, but it is worth asking if the famous parsonage had been placed in a London slum, the dens of Whitechapel would not have had the same result as the lonely Yorkshire moors.</div>
<div class="bmtx1">&#8212;from an unsigned article in the <i>Guardian</i>  (December 21, 1904)</div>
<h1 class="aph1">
QUESTIONS</h1>
<div class="lsl1">1. Can a coherent psychological portrait be drawn of Heathcliff that would account for his character, his motives, his actions? Can you define or describe the complexities of Heathcliff&#8217;s character?</div><div class="lsl1">2. Virginia Woolf doubted that the setting in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>  determined the action. What do you think? Do you agree with her? What do you see to be the relationship between Wuthering Heights the place and <i>Wuthering Heights</i> the book?</div><div class="lsl1">3. William Dean Howells wrote that &#8220;a weird malevolence broods over the gloomy drama, and through all plays a force truly demoniacal.&#8221; Numerous experienced readers have testified to a similar apprehension. How does Emily Bront&#235; create this sense or feeling of a malevolent force?</div><div class="lsl1">4. George Barnett Smith describes <i>Wuthering Heights</i> as &#8220;perhaps one of the most unpleasant books ever written.&#8221; What do you think may have troubled Smith, as well as other nineteenth-century readers of the novel? How might the novel have offended contemporary custodians of morality? In what ways is it subversive? In what ways does it remain unsettling today?</div>
