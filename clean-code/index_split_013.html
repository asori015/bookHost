<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_24">Chapter 2: Meaningful Names</h2>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Don’t Be Cute</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If names are too clever, they will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">memorable only to people who share the</p>
<p class="calibre1">author’s sense of humor, and only as long</p>
<p class="calibre1">as these people remember the joke. Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">they know what the function named</p>
<p class="calibre1">HolyHandGrenade is supposed to do? Sure,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s cute, but maybe in this case</p>
<p class="calibre1">DeleteItems might be a better name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Choose clarity over entertainment value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cuteness in code often appears in the form of colloquialisms or slang. For example, don’t use the name whack() to mean kill(). Don’t tell little culture-dependent jokes like eatMyShorts() to mean abort().</p>
<p class="calibre1">Say what you mean. Mean what you say.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Pick One Word per Concept</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have  fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes. How do you remember which method name goes with which class? Sadly, you often have to remember which company, group, or individual wrote the library or class in order to remember which term was used. Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers and previous code samples.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern editing environments like Eclipse and IntelliJ-provide context-sensitive clues, such as the list of methods you can call on a given object. But note that the list doesn’t usually give you the comments you wrote around your function names and parameter lists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You are lucky if it gives the parameter  <i class="calibre4">names </i> from function declarations. The function names have to stand alone, and they have to be consistent in order for you to pick the correct method without any additional exploration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise, it’s confusing to have a controller and a manager and a driver in the same code base. What is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a Protocol-Controller? Why are both not controllers or both not managers? Are they both Drivers really? The name leads you to expect two objects that have very different type as well as having different classes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Don’t Pun</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><b class="calibre3">Add Meaningful Context</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">27</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you follow the “one word per concept” rule, you could end up with many classes that have, for example, an add method. As long as the parameter lists and return values of the various add methods are semantically equivalent, all is well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However one might decide to use the word add for “consistency” when he or she is not in fact adding in the same sense. Let’s say we have many classes where add will create a new value by adding or concatenating two existing values. Now let’s say we are writing a new class that has a method that puts its single parameter into a collection. Should we call this method add? It might seem consistent because we have so many other add methods, but in this case, the semantics are different, so we should use a name like insert or append instead. To call the new method add would be a pun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our goal, as authors, is to make our code as easy as possible to understand. We want our code to be a quick skim, not an intense study. We want to use the popular paperback model whereby the author is responsible for making himself clear and not the academic model where it is the scholar’s job to dig the meaning out of the paper.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Use Solution Domain Names</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth. It is not wise to draw every name from the problem domain because we don’t want our coworkers to have to run back and forth to the customer asking what every name means when they already know the concept by a different name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The name AccountVisitor means a great deal to a programmer who is familiar with the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what a JobQueue was? There are lots of very technical things that programmers have to do. Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Use Problem Domain Names</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When there is no “programmer-eese” for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Separating solution and problem domain concepts is part of the job of a good programmer and designer. The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Add Meaningful Context</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves—most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort.</p>
