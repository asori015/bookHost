<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_98">Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures</h2>
<p class="calibre1">So, what if we told the ctxt object to do this?</p>
<p class="calibre1">BufferedOutputStream bos = ctxt.createScratchFileStream(classFileName); That seems like a reasonable thing for an object to do! This allows ctxt to hide its internals and prevents the current function from having to violate the Law of Demeter by navigating through objects it shouldn’t know about.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Data Transfer Objects</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables and no functions. This is sometimes called a data transfer object, or DTO. DTOs are very useful structures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets, and so on. They often become the first in a series of translation stages that convert raw data in a database into objects in the application code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat more common is the “bean” form shown in Listing 6-7. Beans have private variables manipulated by getters and setters. The quasi-encapsulation of beans seems to make some OO purists feel better but usually provides no other benefit.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 6-7 </b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Active Record</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Active Records are special forms of DTOs. They are data structures with public (or bean-accessed) variables; but they typically have navigational methods like save and find. Typically these Active Records are direct translations from database tables, or other data sources.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately we often find that developers try to treat these data structures as though they were objects by putting business rule methods in them. This is awkward because it creates a hybrid between a data structure and an object.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The solution, of course, is to treat the Active Record as a data structure and to create separate objects that contain the business rules and that hide their internal data (which are probably just instances of the Active Record).</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing objects. Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing functions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In any given system we will sometimes want the flexibility to add new data types, and so we prefer objects for that part of the system. Other times we will want the flexibility to add new behaviors, and so in that part of the system we prefer data types and procedures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Good software developers understand these issues without prejudice and choose the approach that is best for the job at hand.</p>

<p class="calibre1">by Michael Feathers</p>
<p class="calibre1">It might seem odd to have a section about error handling in a book about clean code. Error handling is just one of those things that we all have to do when we program. Input can be abnormal and devices can fail. In short, things can go wrong, and when they do, we as programmers are responsible for making sure that our code does what it needs to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The connection to clean code, however, should be clear. Many code bases are completely dominated by error handling. When I say dominated, I don’t mean that error handling is all that they do. I mean that it is nearly impossible to see what the code does because of all of the scattered error handling. Error handling is important,  <i class="calibre4">but if it</i> <i class="calibre4">obscures logic, it’s wrong</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this chapter I’ll outline a number of techniques and considerations that you can use to write code that is both clean and robust—code that handles errors with grace and style.</p>
