<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_260">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">public static Month make(int monthIndex) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">for (Month m : Month.values()) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (m.index == monthIndex)</p>
<p class="calibre1">return m;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid month index " + monthIndex);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public final int index;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Changing MonthConstants to this enum forces quite a few changes to the DayDate class and all it’s users. It took me an hour to make all the changes. However, any function that used to take an int for a month, now takes a Month enumerator. This means we can get rid of the isValidMonthCode method (line 326), and all the month code error checking such as that in monthCodeToQuarter (line 356) [G5].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, we have line 91, serialVersionUID. This variable is used to control the serializer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If we change it, then any DayDate written with an older version of the software won’t be readable anymore and will result in an InvalidClassException. If you don’t declare the serialVersionUID variable, then the compiler automatically generates one for you, and it will be different every time you make a change to the module. I know that all the documents recommend manual control of this variable, but it seems to me that automatic control of serialization is a lot safer [G4]. After all, I’d much rather debug an InvalidClassException than the odd behavior that would ensue if I forgot to change the serialVersionUID. So I’m going to delete the variable—at least for the time being.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">I find the comment on line 93 redundant. Redundant comments are just places to collect lies and misinformation [C2]. So I’m going to get rid of it and its ilk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The comments at line 97 and line 100 talk about serial numbers, which I discussed earlier [C1]. The variables they describe are the earliest and latest possible dates that DayDate can describe. This can be made a bit clearer [N1].</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static final int EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL = 2;     // 1/1/1900</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static final int LATEST_DATE_ORDINAL = 2958465; // 12/31/9999</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not clear to me why EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL is 2 instead of 0. There is a hint in the comment on line 829 that suggests that this has something to do with the way dates are represented in Microsoft Excel. There is a much deeper insight provided in a derivative of DayDate called SpreadsheetDate (Listing B-5, page 382). The comment on line 71 describes the issue nicely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem I have with this is that the issue seems to be related to the implementation of SpreadsheetDate and has nothing to do with DayDate. I conclude from this that 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the reviewers of this text have taken exception to this decision. They contend that in an open source framework it is better to assert manual control over the serial ID so that minor changes to the software don’t cause old serialized dates to be invalid. This is a fair point. However, at least the failure, inconvenient though it might be, has a clear-cut cause. On the other hand, if the author of the class forgets to update the ID, then the failure mode is undefined and might very well be silent. I think the real moral of this story is that you should not expect to deserialize across versions.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a><b class="calibre3">Then Make It Right</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">273</p>
<p class="calibre1">EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL and LATEST_DATE_ORDINAL do not really belong in DayDate and should be moved to SpreadsheetDate [G6].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, a search of the code shows that these variables are used only within SpreadsheetDate. Nothing in DayDate, nor in any other class in the JCommon framework, uses them. Therefore, I’ll move them down into SpreadsheetDate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next variables, MINIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED, and MAXIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED (line 104</p>
<p class="calibre1">and line 107), provide something of a dilemma. It seems clear that if DayDate is an abstract class that provides no foreshadowing of implementation, then it should not inform us about a minimum or maximum year. Again, I am tempted to move these variables down into SpreadsheetDate [G6]. However, a quick search of the users of these variables shows that one other class uses them: RelativeDayOfWeekRule (Listing B-6, page 390). We see that usage at line 177 and line 178 in the getDate function, where they are used to check that the argument to getDate is a valid year. The dilemma is that a user of an abstract class needs information about its implementation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What we need to do is provide this information without polluting DayDate itself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually, we would get implementation information from an instance of a derivative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the getDate function is not passed an instance of a DayDate. It does, however, return such an instance, which means that somewhere it must be creating it. Line 187</p>
<p class="calibre1">through line 205 provide the hint. The DayDate instance is being created by one of the three functions, getPreviousDayOfWeek, getNearestDayOfWeek, or getFollowingDayOfWeek.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking back at the DayDate listing, we see that these functions (lines 638–724) all return a date created by addDays (line 571), which calls createInstance (line 808), which creates a SpreadsheetDate! [G7].</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s generally a bad idea for base classes to know about their derivatives. To fix this, we should use the ABSTRACT FACTORY3 pattern and create a DayDateFactory. This factory will create the instances of DayDate that we need and can also answer questions about the implementation, such as the maximum and minimum dates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public abstract class DayDateFactory {</p>
<p class="calibre1">private static DayDateFactory factory = new SpreadsheetDateFactory(); public static void setInstance(DayDateFactory factory) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">DayDateFactory.factory = factory;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected abstract DayDate _makeDate(int ordinal);</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected abstract DayDate _makeDate(int day, DayDate.Month month, int year); protected abstract DayDate _makeDate(int day, int month, int year); protected abstract DayDate _makeDate(java.util.Date date);</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected abstract int _getMinimumYear();</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected abstract int _getMaximumYear();</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static DayDate makeDate(int ordinal) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return factory._makeDate(ordinal);</p>
