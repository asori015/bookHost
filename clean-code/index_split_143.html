<p class="calibre1">could sum up those hours in the code that prints the report, or we could try to keep a running total in the code that accepts time cards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One way to make this decision is to look at the names of the functions. Let’s say that our report module has a function named getTotalHours. Let’s also say that the module that accepts time cards has a saveTimeCard function. Which of these two functions, by it’s name, implies that it calculates the total? The answer should be obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, there are sometimes performance reasons why the total should be calculated as time cards are accepted rather than when the report is printed. That’s fine, but the names of the functions ought to reflect this. For example, there should be a computeRunning-TotalOfHours function in the timecard module.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G18:  <i class="calibre4">Inappropriate Static</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Math.max(double a, double b) is a good static method. It does not operate on a single instance; indeed, it would be silly to have to say new Math().max(a,b) or even a.max(b).</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the data that max uses comes from its two arguments, and not from any “owning”</p>
<p class="calibre1">object. More to the point, there is almost  <i class="calibre4">no chance </i> that we’d want Math.max to be polymorphic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes, however, we write static functions that should not be static. For example, consider:</p>
<p class="calibre1">HourlyPayCalculator.calculatePay(employee, overtimeRate).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, this seems like a reasonable static function. It doesn’t operate on any particular object and gets all it’s data from it’s arguments. However, there is a reasonable chance that we’ll want this function to be polymorphic. We may wish to implement several different algorithms for calculating hourly pay, for example, OvertimeHourlyPayCalculator and StraightTimeHourlyPayCalculator. So in this case the function should not be static. It should be a nonstatic member function of Employee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In general you should prefer nonstatic methods to static methods. When in doubt, make the function nonstatic. If you really want a function to be static, make sure that there is no chance that you’ll want it to behave polymorphically.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G19:  <i class="calibre4">Use Explanatory Variables</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Kent Beck wrote about this in his great book  <i class="calibre4">Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</i> 8 and again more recently in his equally great book  <i class="calibre4">Implementation Patterns</i>.9 One of the more powerful ways to make a program readable is to break the calculations up into intermediate values that are held in variables with meaningful names.</p>
<p class="calibre1">8.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a><b class="calibre3">General</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">297</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider this example from FitNesse:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matcher match = headerPattern.matcher(line);</p>
<p class="calibre1">if(match.find())</p>
<p class="calibre1">{</p>
<p class="calibre1">String key = match.group(1);</p>
<p class="calibre1">String value = match.group(2);</p>
<p class="calibre1">headers.put(key.toLowerCase(), value);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The simple use of explanatory variables makes it clear that the first matched group is the  <i class="calibre4">key, </i> and the second matched group is the  <i class="calibre4">value</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is hard to overdo this. More explanatory variables are generally better than fewer. It is remarkable how an opaque module can suddenly become transparent simply by breaking the calculations up into well-named intermediate values.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G20:  <i class="calibre4">Function Names Should Say What They Do</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Look at this code:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Date newDate = date.add(5);</p>
<p class="calibre1">Would you expect this to add five days to the date? Or is it weeks, or hours? Is the date instance changed or does the function just return a new Date without changing the old one?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">You can’t tell from the call what the function does</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the function adds five days to the date and changes the date, then it should be called addDaysTo or increaseByDays. If, on the other hand, the function returns a new date that is five days later but does not change the date instance, it should be called daysLater or daysSince.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have to look at the implementation (or documentation) of the function to know what it does, then you should work to find a better name or rearrange the functionality so that it can be placed in functions with better names.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G21:  <i class="calibre4">Understand the Algorithm</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lots of very funny code is written because people don’t take the time to understand the algorithm. They get something to work by plugging in enough if statements and flags, without really stopping to consider what is really going on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Programming is often an exploration. You  <i class="calibre4">think </i> you know the right algorithm for something, but then you wind up fiddling with it, prodding and poking at it, until you get it to “work.” How do you know it “works”? Because it passes the test cases you can think of.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is nothing wrong with this approach. Indeed, often it is the only way to get a function to do what you think it should. However, it is not sufficient to leave the quotation marks around the word “work.”</p>
