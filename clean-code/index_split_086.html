<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_170">Chapter 13: Concurrency</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Writing clean concurrent programs is hard—very hard. It is much easier to write code that executes in a single thread. It is also easy to write multithreaded code that looks fine on the surface but is broken at a deeper level. Such code works fine until the system is placed under stress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this chapter we discuss the need for concurrent programming, and the difficulties it presents. We then present several recommendations for dealing with those difficulties, and writing clean concurrent code. Finally, we conclude with issues related to testing concurrent code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clean Concurrency is a complex topic, worthy of a book by itself. Our strategy in  <i class="calibre4">this</i> book is to present an overview here and provide a more detailed tutorial in “Concurrency II”</p>
<p class="calibre1">on page 317. If you are just curious about concurrency, then this chapter will suffice for you now. If you have a need to understand concurrency at a deeper level, then you should read through the tutorial as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Why Concurrency? </b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Concurrency is a decoupling strategy. It helps us decouple  <i class="calibre4">what </i> gets done from  <i class="calibre4">when </i> it gets done. In single-threaded applications  <i class="calibre4">what </i> and  <i class="calibre4">when </i> are so strongly coupled that the state of the entire application can often be determined by looking at the stack backtrace. A programmer who debugs such a system can set a breakpoint, or a sequence of breakpoints, and  <i class="calibre4">know</i> the state of the system by which breakpoints are hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Decoupling  <i class="calibre4">what </i> from  <i class="calibre4">when </i> can dramatically improve both the throughput and structures of an application. From a structural point of view the application looks like many little collaborating computers rather than one big main loop. This can make the system easier to understand and offers some powerful ways to separate concerns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider, for example, the standard “Servlet” model of Web applications. These systems run under the umbrella of a Web or EJB container that  <i class="calibre4">partially </i> manages concurrency for you. The servlets are executed asynchronously whenever Web requests come in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The servlet programmer does not have to manage all the incoming requests.  <i class="calibre4">In principle,</i> each servlet execution lives in its own little world and is decoupled from all the other servlet executions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course if it were that easy, this chapter wouldn’t be necessary. In fact, the decoupling provided by Web containers is far less than perfect. Servlet programmers have to be very aware, and very careful, to make sure their concurrent programs are correct. Still, the structural benefits of the servlet model are significant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But structure is not the only motive for adopting concurrency. Some systems have response time and throughput constraints that require hand-coded concurrent solutions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, consider a single-threaded information aggregator that acquires information from many different Web sites and merges that information into a daily summary. Because</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a><b class="calibre3">Why Concurrency? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">179</p>
<p class="calibre1">this system is single threaded, it hits each Web site in turn, always finishing one before starting the next. The daily run needs to execute in less than 24 hours. However, as more and more Web sites are added, the time grows until it takes more than 24 hours to gather all the data. The single-thread involves a lot of waiting at Web sockets for I/O to complete.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We could improve the performance by using a multithreaded algorithm that hits more than one Web site at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or consider a system that handles one user at a time and requires only one second of time per user. This system is fairly responsive for a few users, but as the number of users increases, the system’s response time increases. No user wants to get in line behind 150 others! We could improve the response time of this system by handling many users concurrently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or consider a system that interprets large data sets but can only give a complete solution after processing all of them. Perhaps each data set could be processed on a different computer, so that many data sets are being processed in parallel.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Myths and Misconceptions</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">And so there are compelling reasons to adopt concurrency. However, as we said before, concurrency is  <i class="calibre4">hard</i>. If you aren’t very careful, you can create some very nasty situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider these common myths and misconceptions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  <i class="calibre4">Concurrency always improves performance. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Concurrency can  <i class="calibre4">sometimes </i> improve performance, but only when there is a lot of wait time that can be shared between multiple threads or multiple processors. Neither situation is trivial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  <i class="calibre4">Design does not change when writing concurrent programs. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the design of a concurrent algorithm can be remarkably different from the design of a single-threaded system. The decoupling of  <i class="calibre4">what</i> from  <i class="calibre4">when</i> usually has a huge effect on the structure of the system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  <i class="calibre4">Understanding concurrency issues is not important when working with a container</i> <i class="calibre4">such as a Web or EJB container. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, you’d better know just what your container is doing and how to guard against the issues of concurrent update and deadlock described later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here are a few more balanced sound bites regarding writing concurrent software:</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  <i class="calibre4">Concurrency incurs some overhead, </i> both in performance as well as writing additional code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  <i class="calibre4">Correct concurrency is complex, </i> even for simple problems.</p>
