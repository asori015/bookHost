<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_4">Chapter 1: Clean Code</h2>
<p class="calibre1">working mess is better than nothing. We’ve all said we’d go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn’t know LeBlanc’s law:  <i class="calibre4">Later equals never</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">The Total Cost of Owning a Mess</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have been a programmer for more than two or three years, you have probably been significantly slowed down by someone else’s messy code. If you have been a programmer for longer than two or three years, you have probably been slowed down by messy code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The degree of the slowdown can be significant. Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a snail’s pace. Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial. Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots be “understood” so that more tangles, twists, and knots can be added.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero. As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can; they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity. But that new staff is not versed in the design of the system. They don’t know the difference between a change that matches the design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent. Furthermore, they, and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">The Grand Redesign in the Sky</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it’s a green-field project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This race can go on for a very long time. I’ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it’s done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned because it’s such a mess.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then you already know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">Attitude</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Have you ever waded through a mess so grave that it took weeks to do what should have taken hours? Have you seen what should have been a one-line change, made instead in hundreds of different modules? These symptoms are all too common.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why does this happen to code? Why does good code rot so quickly into bad code? We have lots of explanations for it. We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design. We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do things right.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and telephone sanitizers. But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We are unprofessional.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This may be a bitter pill to swallow. How could this mess be  <i class="calibre4">our </i> fault? What about the requirements? What about the schedule? What about the stupid managers and the useless marketing types? Don’t they bear some of the blame?</p>
<p class="calibre1">No. The managers and marketers look to  <i class="calibre4">us </i> for the information they need to make promises and commitments; and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy about telling them what we think. The users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system. The project managers look to us to help work out the schedule. We <a id="p37"></a>6</p>
