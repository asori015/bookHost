<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_18">Chapter 2: Meaningful Names</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings? The words have frightfully similar shapes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spelling similar concepts similarly is  <i class="calibre4">information</i>. Using inconsistent spellings is  <i class="calibre4">disinformation</i>. With modern Java environments we enjoy automatic code completion. We write a few characters of a name and press some hotkey combination (if that) and are rewarded with a list of possible completions for that name. It is very helpful if names for very similar things sort together alphabetically and if the differences are very obvious, because the developer is likely to pick an object by name without seeing your copious comments or even the list of methods supplied by that class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">int a = l;</p>
<p class="calibre1">if ( O == l )</p>
<p class="calibre1">a = O1;</p>
<p class="calibre1">else</p>
<p class="calibre1">l = 01;</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reader may think this a contrivance, but we have examined code where such things were abundant. In one case the author of the code suggested using a different font so that the differences were more obvious, a solution that would have to be passed down to all future developers as oral tradition or in a written document. The problem is conquered with finality and without creating new work products by a simple renaming.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Programmers create problems for them-</p>
<p class="calibre1">selves when they write code solely to sat-</p>
<p class="calibre1">isfy a compiler or interpreter. For example,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because you can’t use the same name to refer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to two different things in the same scope,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you might be tempted to change one name</p>
<p class="calibre1">in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling errors leads to an inability to compile.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words, even though the compiler is satisfied. If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider, for example, the truly hideous practice of creating a variable named klass just because the name class was used for something else.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre3">Use Pronounceable Names</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">21</p>
<p class="calibre1">Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) is the opposite of intentional naming. Such names are not disinformative—they are noninformative; they provide no clue to the author’s intention. Consider:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">for (int i = 0; i &lt; a1.length; i++) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">a2[i] = a1[i];</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">This function reads much better when source and destination are used for the argument names.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a Product class. If you have another called ProductInfo or ProductData, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like a, an, and the.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Note that there is nothing wrong with using prefix conventions like a and the so long as they make a meaningful distinction. For example you might use a for all local variables and the for all function arguments.3 The problem comes in when you decide to call a variable theZork because you already have another variable named zork.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a variable name. The word table should never appear in a table name. How is NameString better than Name? Would a Name ever be a floating point number? If so, it breaks an earlier rule about disinformation. Imagine finding one class named Customer and another named CustomerObject. What should you understand as the distinction? Which one will represent the best path to a customer’s payment history?</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an application we know of where this is illustrated. we’ve changed the names to protect the guilty, but here’s the exact form of the error: getActiveAccount();</p>
<p class="calibre1">getActiveAccounts();</p>
<p class="calibre1">getActiveAccountInfo();</p>
<p class="calibre1">How are the programmers in this project supposed to know which of these functions to call?</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the absence of specific conventions, the variable moneyAmount is indistinguishable from money, customerInfo is indistinguishable from customer, accountData is indistinguishable from account, and theMessage is indistinguishable from message. Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">Use Pronounceable Names</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans are good at words. A significant part of our brains is dedicated to the concept of words. And words are, by definition, pronounceable. It would be a shame not to take 3.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Bob used to do this in C++ but has given up the practice because modern IDEs make it unnecessary.</p>
