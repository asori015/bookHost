<p class="calibre1">All else being equal, we want to eliminate Feature Envy because it exposes the internals of one class to another. Sometimes, however, Feature Envy is a necessary evil. Consider the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public class HourlyEmployeeReport {</p>
<p class="calibre1">private HourlyEmployee employee ;</p>
<p class="calibre1">public HourlyEmployeeReport(HourlyEmployee e) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.employee = e;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">String reportHours() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return String.format(</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Name: %s\tHours:%d.%1d\n",</p>
<p class="calibre1">employee.getName(),</p>
<p class="calibre1">employee.getTenthsWorked()/10,</p>
<p class="calibre1">employee.getTenthsWorked()%10);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, the reportHours method envies the HourlyEmployee class. On the other hand, we don’t want HourlyEmployee to have to know about the format of the report. Moving that format string into the HourlyEmployee class would violate several principles of object oriented design.7 It would couple HourlyEmployee to the format of the report, exposing it to changes in that format.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G15:  <i class="calibre4">Selector Arguments</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is hardly anything more abominable than a dangling false argument at the end of a function call. What does it mean? What would it change if it were true? Not only is the purpose of a selector argument difficult to remember, each selector argument combines many functions into one. Selector arguments are just a lazy way to avoid splitting a large function into several smaller functions. Consider: public int calculateWeeklyPay(boolean overtime) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int tenthRate = getTenthRate();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int tenthsWorked = getTenthsWorked();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int straightTime = Math.min(400, tenthsWorked);</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overTime = Math.max(0, tenthsWorked - straightTime);</p>
<p class="calibre1">int straightPay = straightTime * tenthRate;</p>
<p class="calibre1">double overtimeRate = overtime ? 1.5 : 1.0 * tenthRate;</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overtimePay = (int)Math.round(overTime*overtimeRate);</p>
<p class="calibre1">return straightPay + overtimePay;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">You call this function with a true if overtime is paid as time and a half, and with a false if overtime is paid as straight time. It’s bad enough that you must remember what calculateWeeklyPay(false) means whenever you happen to stumble across it. But the 7.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically, the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open Closed Principle, and the Common Closure Principle. See [PPP].</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a><b class="calibre3">General</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">295</p>
<p class="calibre1">real shame of a function like this is that the author missed the opportunity to write the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int straightPay() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return getTenthsWorked() * getTenthRate();</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int overTimePay() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overTimeTenths = Math.max(0, getTenthsWorked() - 400);</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overTimePay = overTimeBonus(overTimeTenths);</p>
<p class="calibre1">return straightPay() + overTimePay;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">private int overTimeBonus(int overTimeTenths) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">double bonus = 0.5 * getTenthRate() * overTimeTenths;</p>
<p class="calibre1">return (int) Math.round(bonus);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, selectors need not be boolean. They can be enums, integers, or any other type of argument that is used to select the behavior of the function. In general it is better to have many functions than to pass some code into a function to select the behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G16:  <i class="calibre4">Obscured Intent</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We want code to be as expressive as possible. Run-on expressions, Hungarian notation, and magic numbers all obscure the author’s intent. For example, here is the overTimePay function as it might have appeared: public int m_otCalc() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return iThsWkd * iThsRte +</p>
<p class="calibre1">(int) Math.round(0.5 * iThsRte *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Math.max(0, iThsWkd - 400)</p>
<p class="calibre1">);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Small and dense as this might appear, it’s also virtually impenetrable. It is worth taking the time to make the intent of our code visible to our readers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G17:  <i class="calibre4">Misplaced Responsibility</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important decisions a software developer can make is where to put code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, where should the PI constant go? Should it be in the Math class? Perhaps it belongs in the Trigonometry class? Or maybe in the Circle class?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The principle of least surprise comes into play here. Code should be placed where a reader would naturally expect it to be. The PI constant should go where the trig functions are declared. The OVERTIME_RATE constant should be declared in the HourlyPayCalculator class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes we get “clever” about where to put certain functionality. We’ll put it in a function that’s convenient for us, but not necessarily intuitive to the reader. For example, perhaps we need to print a report with the total of hours that an employee worked. We <a id="p327"></a>296</p>
