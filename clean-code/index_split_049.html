<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_96">Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures</h2>
<p class="calibre1">• An object passed as an argument to  <i class="calibre4">f</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">• An object held in an instance variable of  <i class="calibre4">C</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The method should  <i class="calibre4">not </i> invoke methods on objects that are returned by any of the allowed functions. In other words, talk to friends, not to strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following code3 appears to violate the Law of Demeter (among other things) because it calls the getScratchDir() function on the return value of getOptions() and then calls getAbsolutePath() on the return value of getScratchDir().</p>
<p class="calibre1">final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Train Wrecks</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This kind of code is often called a  <i class="calibre4">train wreck </i> because it look like a bunch of coupled train cars. Chains of calls like this are generally considered to be sloppy style and should be avoided [G36]. It is usually best to split them up as follows: Options opts = ctxt.getOptions(); File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();</p>
<p class="calibre1">final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();</p>
<p class="calibre1">Are these two snippets of code viola-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions of the Law of Demeter? Certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">the containing module knows that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ctxt object contains options, which con-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tain a scratch directory, which has an</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute path. That’s a lot of knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">for one function to know. The calling</p>
<p class="calibre1">function knows how to navigate through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a lot of different objects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether this is a violation of Demeter depends on whether or not ctxt, Options, and ScratchDir are objects or data structures. If they are objects, then their internal structure should be hidden rather than exposed, and so knowledge of their innards is a clear violation of the Law of Demeter. On the other hand, if ctxt, Options, and ScratchDir are just data structures with no behavior, then they naturally expose their internal structure, and so Demeter does not apply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The use of accessor functions confuses the issue. If the code had been written as follows, then we probably wouldn’t be asking about Demeter violations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">final String outputDir = ctxt.options.scratchDir.absolutePath; This issue would be a lot less confusing if data structures simply had public variables and no functions, whereas objects had private variables and public functions. However, 3.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Found somewhere in the apache framework.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a><b class="calibre3">The Law of Demeter</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">99</p>
<p class="calibre1">there are frameworks and standards (e.g., “beans”) that demand that even simple data structures have accessors and mutators.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Hybrids</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This confusion sometimes leads to unfortunate hybrid structures that are half object and half data structure. They have functions that do significant things, and they also have either public variables or public accessors and mutators that, for all intents and purposes, make the private variables public, tempting other external functions to use those variables the way a procedural program would use a data structure.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such hybrids make it hard to add new functions but also make it hard to add new data structures. They are the worst of both worlds. Avoid creating them. They are indicative of a muddled design whose authors are unsure of—or worse, ignorant of—whether they need protection from functions or types.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p11"><b class="calibre3">Hiding Structure</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">What if ctxt, options, and scratchDir are objects with real behavior? Then, because objects are supposed to hide their internal structure, we should not be able to navigate through them. How then would we get the absolute path of the scratch directory?</p>
<p class="calibre1">ctxt.getAbsolutePathOfScratchDirectoryOption();</p>
<p class="calibre1">or</p>
<p class="calibre1">ctx.getScratchDirectoryOption().getAbsolutePath()</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first option could lead to an explosion of methods in the ctxt object. The second presumes that getScratchDirectoryOption() returns a data structure, not an object. Neither option feels good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If ctxt is an object, we should be telling it to  <i class="calibre4">do something; </i> we should not be asking it about its internals. So why did we want the absolute path of the scratch directory? What were we going to do with it? Consider this code from (many lines farther down in) the same module: String outFile = outputDir + "/" + className.replace('.', '/') + ".class"; FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(outFile);</p>
<p class="calibre1">BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fout);</p>
<p class="calibre1">The admixture of different levels of detail [G34][G6] is a bit troubling. Dots, slashes, file extensions, and File objects should not be so carelessly mixed together, and mixed with the enclosing code. Ignoring that, however, we see that the intent of getting the absolute path of the scratch directory was to create a scratch file of a given name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is sometimes called Feature Envy from [Refactoring].</p>
