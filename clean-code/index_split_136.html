<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_270">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">We have finally made it to the abstract methods of this abstract class. And the first one is as appropriate as they come: toSerial (lines 838–844). Back on page 279 I had changed the name to toOrdinal. Having looked at it in this context, I decided the name should be changed to getOrdinalDay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next abstract method is toDate (lines 838–844). It converts a DayDate to a java.util.Date. Why is this method abstract? If we look at its implementation in SpreadsheetDate (lines 198–207, Listing B-5, page 382), we see that it doesn’t depend on anything in the implementation of that class [G6]. So I pushed it up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The getYYYY, getMonth, and getDayOfMonth methods are nicely abstract. However, the getDayOfWeek method is another one that should be pulled up from SpreadSheetDate because it doesn’t depend on anything that can’t be found in DayDate [G6]. Or does it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look carefully (line 247, Listing B-5, page 382), you’ll see that the algorithm implicitly depends on the origin of the ordinal day (in other words, the day of the week of day 0). So even though this function has no physical dependencies that couldn’t be moved to DayDate, it does have a logical dependency.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Logical dependencies like this bother me [G22]. If something logical depends on the implementation, then something physical should too. Also, it seems to me that the algorithm itself could be generic with a much smaller portion of it dependent on the implementation [G6].</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I created an abstract method in DayDate named getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero and implemented it in SpreadsheetDate to return Day.SATURDAY. Then I moved the getDayOfWeek method up to DayDate and changed it to call getOrdinalDay and getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public Day getDayOfWeek() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">Day startingDay = getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int startingOffset = startingDay.index - Day.SUNDAY.index;</p>
<p class="calibre1">return Day.make((getOrdinalDay() + startingOffset) % 7 + 1);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a side note, look carefully at the comment on line 895 through line 899. Was this repetition really necessary? As usual, I deleted this comment along with all the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next method is compare (lines 902–913). Again, this method is inappropriately abstract [G6], so I pulled the implementation up into DayDate. Also, the name does not communicate enough [N1]. This method actually returns the difference in days since the argument. So I changed the name to daysSince. Also, I noted that there weren’t any tests for this method, so I wrote them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next six functions (lines 915–980) are all abstract methods that should be implemented in DayDate. So I pulled them all up from SpreadsheetDate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last function, isInRange (lines 982–995) also needs to be pulled up and refactored. The switch statement is a bit ugly [G23] and can be replaced by moving the cases into the DateInterval enum.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a><b class="calibre3">Then Make It Right</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">283</p>
<p class="calibre1">public enum DateInterval {</p>
<p class="calibre1">OPEN {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return d &gt; left &amp;&amp; d &lt; right;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">},</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLOSED_LEFT {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return d &gt;= left &amp;&amp; d &lt; right;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">},</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLOSED_RIGHT {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return d &gt; left &amp;&amp; d &lt;= right;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">},</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLOSED {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return d &gt;= left &amp;&amp; d &lt;= right;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">};</p>
<p class="calibre1">public abstract boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isInRange(DayDate d1, DayDate d2, DateInterval interval) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int left = Math.min(d1.getOrdinalDay(), d2.getOrdinalDay());</p>
<p class="calibre1">int right = Math.max(d1.getOrdinalDay(), d2.getOrdinalDay());</p>
<p class="calibre1">return interval.isIn(getOrdinalDay(), left, right);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">That brings us to the end of DayDate. So now we’ll make one more pass over the whole class to see how well it flows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the opening comment is long out of date, so I shortened and improved it [C2].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, I moved all the remaining enums out into their own files [G12].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, I moved the static variable (dateFormatSymbols) and three static methods (getMonthNames <i class="calibre4">, </i> isLeapYear <i class="calibre4">, </i> lastDayOfMonth) into a new class named DateUtil [G6].</p>
<p class="calibre1">I moved the abstract methods up to the top where they belong [G24].</p>
<p class="calibre1">I changed Month.make to Month.fromInt [N1] and did the same for all the other enums.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also created a toInt() accessor for all the enums and made the index field private.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was some interesting duplication [G5] in plusYears and plusMonths that I was able to eliminate by extracting a new method named correctLastDayOfMonth, making the all three methods much clearer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got rid of the magic number 1 [G25], replacing it with Month.JANUARY.toInt() or Day.SUNDAY.toInt(), as appropriate. I spent a little time with SpreadsheetDate, cleaning up the algorithms a bit. The end result is contained in Listing B-7, page 394, through Listing B-16, page 405.</p>
