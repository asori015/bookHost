<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_280">Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Good software developers learn to limit what they expose at the interfaces of their classes and modules. The fewer methods a class has, the better. The fewer variables a function knows about, the better. The fewer instance variables a class has, the better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hide your data. Hide your utility functions. Hide your constants and your temporaries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance variables. Don’t create lots of protected variables and functions for your subclasses. Concentrate on keeping interfaces very tight and very small. Help keep coupling low by limiting information.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G9:  <i class="calibre4">Dead Code</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dead code is code that isn’t executed. You find it in the body of an if statement that checks for a condition that can’t happen. You find it in the catch block of a try that never throws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You find it in little utility methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never occur.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is not completely updated when designs change. It still  <i class="calibre4">compiles</i>, but it does not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the system was  <i class="calibre4">different</i>. When you find dead code, do the right thing. Give it a decent burial. Delete it from the system.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G10:  <i class="calibre4">Vertical Separation</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Variables and function should be defined close to where they are used. Local variables should be declared just above their first usage and should have a small vertical scope. We don’t want local variables declared hundreds of lines distant from their usages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Private functions should be defined just below their first usage. Private functions belong to the scope of the whole class, but we’d still like to limit the vertical distance between the invocations and definitions. Finding a private function should just be a matter of scanning downward from the first usage.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G11:  <i class="calibre4">Inconsistency</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way. This goes back to the principle of least surprise. Be careful with the conventions you choose, and once chosen, be careful to continue to follow them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If within a particular function you use a variable named response to hold an HttpServletResponse, then use the same variable name consistently in the other functions that use HttpServletResponse objects. If you name a method processVerificationRequest, then use a similar name, such as processDeletionRequest, for the methods that process other kinds of requests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simple consistency like this, when reliably applied, can make code much easier to read and modify.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G12:  <i class="calibre4">Clutter</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of what use is a default constructor with no implementation? All it serves to do is clutter up the code with meaningless artifacts. Variables that aren’t used, functions that are never called, comments that add no information, and so forth. All these things are clutter and should be removed. Keep your source files clean, well organized, and free of clutter.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G13:  <i class="calibre4">Artificial Coupling</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Things that don’t depend upon each other should not be artificially coupled. For example, general enums should not be contained within more specific classes because this forces the whole application to know about these more specific classes. The same goes for general purpose static functions being declared in specific classes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In general an artificial coupling is a coupling between two modules that serves no direct purpose. It is a result of putting a variable, constant, or function in a temporarily convenient, though inappropriate, location. This is lazy and careless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the time to figure out where functions, constants, and variables ought to be declared. Don’t just toss them in the most convenient place at hand and then leave them there.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G14:  <i class="calibre4">Feature Envy</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one of Martin Fowler’s code smells.6 The methods of a class should be interested in the variables and functions of the class they belong to, and not the variables and functions of other classes. When a method uses accessors and mutators of some other object to manipulate the data within that object, then it  <i class="calibre4">envies </i> the scope of the class of that other object. It wishes that it were inside that other class so that it could have direct access to the variables it is manipulating. For example: public class HourlyPayCalculator {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public Money calculateWeeklyPay(HourlyEmployee e) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int tenthRate = e.getTenthRate().getPennies();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int tenthsWorked = e.getTenthsWorked();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int straightTime = Math.min(400, tenthsWorked);</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overTime = Math.max(0, tenthsWorked - straightTime);</p>
<p class="calibre1">int straightPay = straightTime * tenthRate;</p>
<p class="calibre1">int overtimePay = (int)Math.round(overTime*tenthRate*1.5);</p>
<p class="calibre1">return new Money(straightPay + overtimePay);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The calculateWeeklyPay method reaches into the HourlyEmployee object to get the data on which it operates. The calculateWeeklyPay method  <i class="calibre4">envies </i> the scope of HourlyEmployee. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">“wishes” that it could be inside HourlyEmployee.</p>
