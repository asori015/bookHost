<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_28">Chapter 2: Meaningful Names</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The names accountAddress and customerAddress are fine names for instances of the class Address but could be poor names for classes. Address is a fine name for a class. If I need to differentiate between MAC addresses, port addresses, and Web addresses, I might consider PostalAddress, MAC, and URI. The resulting names are more precise, which is the point of all naming.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Final Words</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background. This is a teaching issue rather than a technical, business, or management issue. As a result many people in this field don’t learn to do it very well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People are also afraid of renaming things for fear that some other developers will object. We do not share that fear and find that we are actually grateful when names change (for the better). Most of the time we don’t really memorize the names of classes and methods. We use the modern tools to deal with details like that so we can focus on whether the code reads like paragraphs and sentences, or at least like tables and data structure (a sentence isn’t always the best way to display data). You will probably end up surprising someone when you rename, just like you might with any other code improvement. Don’t let it stop you in your tracks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Follow some of these rules and see whether you don’t improve the readability of your code. If you are maintaining someone else’s code, use refactoring tools to help resolve these problems. It will pay off in the short term and continue to pay in the long run.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Functions</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early days of programming we composed our systems of routines and subroutines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, in the era of Fortran and PL/1 we composed our systems of programs, subprograms, and functions. Nowadays only the function survives from those early days. Functions are the first line of organization in any program. Writing them well is the topic of this chapter.</p>
