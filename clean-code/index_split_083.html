<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_164">Chapter 12: Emergence</h2>
<p class="calibre1">According to Kent, a design is “simple” if it follows these rules:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Runs all the tests</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Contains no duplication</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Expresses the intent of the programmer</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Minimizes the number of classes and methods</p>
<p class="calibre1">The rules are given in order of importance.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Simple Design Rule 1: Runs All the Tests</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">First and foremost, a design must produce a system that acts as intended. A system might have a perfect design on paper, but if there is no simple way to verify that the system actually works as intended, then all the paper effort is questionable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time is a testable system. That’s an obvious statement, but an important one. Systems that aren’t testable aren’t verifiable. Arguably, a system that cannot be verified should never be deployed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, making our systems testable pushes us toward a design where our classes are small and single purpose. It’s just easier to test classes that conform to the SRP. The more tests we write, the more we’ll continue to push toward things that are simpler to test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So making sure our system is fully testable helps us create better designs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tight coupling makes it difficult to write tests. So, similarly, the more tests we write, the more we use principles like DIP and tools like dependency injection, interfaces, and abstraction to minimize coupling. Our designs improve even more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remarkably, following a simple and obvious rule that says we need to have tests and run them continuously impacts our system’s adherence to the primary OO goals of low coupling and high cohesion. Writing tests leads to better designs.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Simple Design Rules 2–4: Refactoring</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Once we have tests, we are empowered to keep our code and classes clean. We do this by incrementally refactoring the code. For each few lines of code we add, we pause and reflect on the new design. Did we just degrade it? If so, we clean it up and run our tests to demonstrate that we haven’t broken anything.  <i class="calibre4">The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear</i> <i class="calibre4">that cleaning up the code will break it! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During this refactoring step, we can apply anything from the entire body of knowledge about good software design. We can increase cohesion, decrease coupling, separate concerns, modularize system concerns, shrink our functions and classes, choose better names, and so on. This is also where we apply the final three rules of simple design: Eliminate duplication, ensure expressiveness, and minimize the number of classes and methods.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a><b class="calibre3">No Duplication</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">173</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">No Duplication</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. It represents additional work, additional risk, and additional unnecessary complexity. Duplication manifests itself in many forms. Lines of code that look exactly alike are, of course, duplication.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lines of code that are similar can often be massaged to look even more alike so that they can be more easily refactored. And duplication can exist in other forms such as duplication of implementation. For example, we might have two methods in a collection class: int size() {}</p>
<p class="calibre1">boolean isEmpty() {}</p>
<p class="calibre1">We could have separate implementations for each method. The isEmpty method could track a boolean, while size could track a counter. Or, we can eliminate this duplication by tying isEmpty to the definition of size: boolean isEmpty() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return 0 == size();</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creating a clean system requires the will to eliminate duplication, even in just a few lines of code. For example, consider the following code:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void scaleToOneDimension(</p>
<p class="calibre1">float desiredDimension, float imageDimension) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (Math.abs(desiredDimension - imageDimension) &lt; errorThreshold) return;</p>
<p class="calibre1">float scalingFactor = desiredDimension / imageDimension;</p>
<p class="calibre1">scalingFactor = (float)(Math.floor(scalingFactor * 100) * 0.01f); RenderedOp newImage = ImageUtilities.getScaledImage(</p>
<p class="calibre1">image, scalingFactor, scalingFactor);</p>
<p class="calibre1">image.dispose();</p>
<p class="calibre1">System.gc();</p>
<p class="calibre1">image = newImage;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public synchronized void rotate(int degrees) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">RenderedOp newImage = ImageUtilities.getRotatedImage(</p>
<p class="calibre1">image, degrees);</p>
<p class="calibre1">image.dispose();</p>
<p class="calibre1">System.gc();</p>
<p class="calibre1">image = newImage;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">To keep this system clean, we should eliminate the small amount of duplication between the scaleToOneDimension and rotate methods:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void scaleToOneDimension(</p>
<p class="calibre1">float desiredDimension, float imageDimension) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (Math.abs(desiredDimension - imageDimension) &lt; errorThreshold) return;</p>
<p class="calibre1">float scalingFactor = desiredDimension / imageDimension;</p>
<p class="calibre1">scalingFactor = (float)(Math.floor(scalingFactor * 100) * 0.01f);</p>
