<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_6">Chapter 1: Clean Code</h2>
<p class="calibre1">are deeply complicit in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code!</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But wait!” you say. “If I don’t do what my manager says, I’ll be fired.” Probably not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s  <i class="calibre4">your </i> job to defend the code with equal passion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To drive this point home, what if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time?2 Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of dis-ease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">The Primal Conundrum</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Programmers face a conundrum of basic values. All developers with more than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down. And yet all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines. In short, they don’t take the time to go fast!</p>
<p class="calibre1">True professionals know that the second part of the conundrum is wrong. You will  <i class="calibre4">not</i> make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. The  <i class="calibre4">only </i> way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">The Art of Clean Code? </b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s say you believe that messy code is a significant impediment. Let’s say that you accept that the only way to go fast is to keep your code clean. Then you must ask yourself: “How do I write clean code?” It’s no good trying to write clean code if you don’t know what it means for code to be clean!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bad news is that writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Most of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When hand-washing was first recommended to physicians by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847, it was rejected on the basis that doctors were too busy and wouldn’t have time to wash their hands between patient visits.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Total Cost of Owning a Mess</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.” This “code-sense” is the key.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to fight to acquire it. Not only does it let us see whether code is good or bad, but it also shows us the strategy for applying our discipline to transform bad code into clean code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A programmer without “code-sense” can look at a messy module and recognize the mess but will have no idea what to do about it. A programmer  <i class="calibre4">with</i> “code-sense” will look at a messy module and see options and variations. The “code-sense” will help that programmer choose the best variation and guide him or her to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations to get from here to there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">What Is Clean Code? </b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers. So I asked some very well-known and deeply experienced programmers what they thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">and author of  <i class="calibre4">The C++ Programming </i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Language</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">logic should be straightforward to make it hard</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ease maintenance, error handling complete</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">according to an articulated strategy, and per-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">formance close to optimal so as not to tempt</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">people to make the code messy with unprinci-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pled optimizations. Clean code does one thing</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">well. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bjarne uses the word “elegant.” That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite a word! The dictionary in my MacBook®</p>
<p class="calibre1">provides the following definitions:  <i class="calibre4">pleasingly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">graceful and stylish in appearance or manner; pleasingly ingenious and simple. </i> Notice the emphasis on the word “pleasing.” Apparently Bjarne thinks that clean code is  <i class="calibre4">pleasing </i> to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bjarne also mentions efficiency— <i class="calibre4">twice</i>. Perhaps this should not surprise us coming from the inventor of C++; but I think there’s more to it than the sheer desire for speed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wasted cycles are inelegant, they are not pleasing. And now note the word that Bjarne uses</p>
