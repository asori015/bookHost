<p class="calibre1">interpretation and formatting of the size variable. This points out that when you break a function along lines of abstraction, you often uncover new lines of abstraction that were obscured by the previous structure.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">G35:  <i class="calibre4">Keep Configurable Data at High Levels</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have a constant such as a default or configuration value that is known and expected at a high level of abstraction, do not bury it in a low-level function. Expose it as an argument to that low-level function called from the high-level function. Consider the following code from FitNesse: public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception</p>
<p class="calibre1">{</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arguments arguments = parseCommandLine(args);</p>
<p class="calibre1">...</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public class Arguments</p>
<p class="calibre1">{</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static final String DEFAULT_PATH = ".";</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static final String DEFAULT_ROOT = "FitNesseRoot"; public static final int DEFAULT_PORT = 80;</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static final int DEFAULT_VERSION_DAYS = 14;</p>
<p class="calibre1">...</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The command-line arguments are parsed in the very first executable line of FitNesse. The default values of those arguments are specified at the top of the Argument class. You don’t have to go looking in low levels of the system for statements like this one: if (arguments.port == 0) // use 80 by default The configuration constants reside at a very high level and are easy to change. They get passed down to the rest of the application. The lower levels of the application do not own the values of these constants.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In general we don’t want a single module to know much about its collaborators. More specifically, if A collaborates with B, and B collaborates with C, we don’t want modules that use A to know about C. (For example, we don’t want a.getB().getC().doSomething();.) This is sometimes called the Law of Demeter. The Pragmatic Programmers call it “Writing Shy Code.”12 In either case it comes down to making sure that modules know only about their immediate collaborators and do not know the navigation map of the whole system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If many modules used some form of the statement a.getB().getC(), then it would be difficult to change the design and architecture to interpose a Q between  B and C. You’d 12. [PRAG], p. 138.</p>

<p class="calibre1">307</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to find every instance of a.getB().getC() and convert it to a.getB().getQ().getC().</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is how architectures become rigid. Too many modules know too much about the architecture.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather we want our immediate collaborators to offer all the services we need. We should not have to roam through the object graph of the system, hunting for the method we want to call. Rather we should simply be able to say: myCollaborator.doSomething().</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p16"><b class="calibre3">J1:  <i class="calibre4">Avoid Long Import Lists by Using Wildcards</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you use two or more classes from a package, then import the whole package with import package.*;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Long lists of imports are daunting to the reader. We don’t want to clutter up the tops of our modules with 80 lines of imports. Rather we want the imports to be a concise statement about which packages we collaborate with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specific imports are hard dependencies, whereas wildcard imports are not. If you specifically import a class, then that class  <i class="calibre4">must </i> exist. But if you import a package with a wildcard, no particular classes need to exist. The import statement simply adds the package to the search path when hunting for names. So no true dependency is created by such imports, and they therefore serve to keep our modules less coupled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are times when the long list of specific imports can be useful. For example, if you are dealing with legacy code and you want to find out what classes you need to build mocks and stubs for, you can walk down the list of specific imports to find out the true qualified names of all those classes and then put the appropriate stubs in place. However, this use for specific imports is very rare. Furthermore, most modern IDEs will allow you to convert the wildcarded imports to a list of specific imports with a single command. So even in the legacy case it’s better to import wildcards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wildcard imports can sometimes cause name conflicts and ambiguities. Two classes with the same name, but in different packages, will need to be specifically imported, or at least specifically qualified when used. This can be a nuisance but is rare enough that using wildcard imports is still generally better than specific imports.</p>

<p class="calibre1">I have seen this several times and it always makes me grimace. A programmer puts some constants in an interface and then gains access to those constants by inheriting that interface. Take a look at the following code: public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {</p>
<p class="calibre1">private int tenthsWorked;</p>
<p class="calibre1">private double hourlyRate;</p>
