<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_42">Chapter 3: Functions</h2>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Have No Side Effects</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Side effects are lies. Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does other  <i class="calibre4">hidden</i> things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes it will make them to the parameters passed into the function or to system globals. In either case they are devious and damaging mistruths that often result in strange temporal couplings and order dependencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider, for example, the seemingly innocuous function in Listing 3-6. This function uses a standard algorithm to match a userName to a password. It returns true if they match and false if anything goes wrong. But it also has a side effect. Can you spot it?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 3-6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">UserValidator.java</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">public class UserValidator {</p>
<p class="calibre1">private Cryptographer cryptographer;</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean checkPassword(String userName, String password) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">User user = UserGateway.findByName(userName);</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (user != User.NULL) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">String codedPhrase = user.getPhraseEncodedByPassword();</p>
<p class="calibre1">String phrase = cryptographer.decrypt(codedPhrase, password);</p>
<p class="calibre1">if ("Valid Password".equals(phrase)) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">Session.initialize();</p>
<p class="calibre1">return true;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">return false;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The side effect is the call to Session.initialize(), of course. The checkPassword function, by its name, says that it checks the password. The name does not imply that it initializes the session. So a caller who believes what the name of the function says runs the risk of erasing the existing session data when he or she decides to check the validity of the user.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This side effect creates a temporal coupling. That is, checkPassword can only be called at certain times (in other words, when it is safe to initialize the session). If it is called out of order, session data may be inadvertently lost. Temporal couplings are confusing, especially when hidden as a side effect. If you must have a temporal coupling, you should make it clear in the name of the function. In this case we might rename the function checkPasswordAndInitializeSession, though that certainly violates “Do one thing.”</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Output Arguments</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Arguments are most naturally interpreted as  <i class="calibre4">inputs </i> to a function. If you have been programming for more than a few years, I’m sure you’ve done a double-take on an argument that was actually an  <i class="calibre4">output</i> rather than an input. For example: appendFooter(s); Does this function append s as the footer to something? Or does it append some footer to s? Is s an input or an output? It doesn’t take long to look at the function signature and see:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void appendFooter(StringBuffer report)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This clarifies the issue, but only at the expense of checking the declaration of the function.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anything that forces you to check the function signature is equivalent to a double-take. It’s a cognitive break and should be avoided.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the days before object oriented programming it was sometimes necessary to have output arguments. However, much of the need for output arguments disappears in OO languages because this is  <i class="calibre4">intended </i> to act as an output argument. In other words, it would be better for appendFooter to be invoked as report.appendFooter();</p>
<p class="calibre1">In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Command Query Separation</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion. Consider, for example, the following function: public boolean set(String attribute, String value);</p>
<p class="calibre1">This function sets the value of a named attribute and returns true if it is successful and false if no such attribute exists. This leads to odd statements like this: if (set("username", "unclebob"))...</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine this from the point of view of the reader. What does it mean? Is it asking whether the “username” attribute was previously set to “unclebob”? Or is it asking whether the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“username” attribute was successfully set to “unclebob”? It’s hard to infer the meaning from the call because it’s not clear whether the word “set” is a verb or an adjective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The author intended set to be a verb, but in the context of the if statement it  <i class="calibre4">feels </i> like an adjective. So the statement reads as “If the username attribute was previously set to unclebob” and not “set the username attribute to unclebob and if that worked then. . . .” We <a id="p77"></a>46</p>
