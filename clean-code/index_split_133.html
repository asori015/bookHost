<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_264">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">The second set of constants (lines 177–187) is a bit more obscure. The INCLUDE_NONE, INCLUDE_FIRST, INCLUDE_SECOND, and INCLUDE_BOTH constants are used to describe whether the defining end-point dates of a range should be included in that range. Mathematically, this is described using the terms “open interval,” “half-open interval,” and “closed interval.” I think it is clearer using the mathematical nomenclature [N3], so I changed it to an enum named DateInterval with CLOSED, CLOSED_LEFT, CLOSED_RIGHT, and OPEN enumerators.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The third set of constants (lines 18–205) describe whether a search for a particular day of the week should result in the last, next, or nearest instance. Deciding what to call this is difficult at best. In the end, I settled for WeekdayRange with LAST, NEXT, and NEAREST</p>
<p class="calibre1">enumerators.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You might not agree with the names I’ve chosen. They make sense to me, but they may not make sense to you. The point is that they are now in a form that makes them easy to change [J3]. They aren’t passed as integers anymore; they are passed as symbols. I can use the “change name” function of my IDE to change the names, or the types, without worrying that I missed some -1 or 2 somewhere in the code or that some int argument declaration is left poorly described.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The description field at line 208 does not seem to be used by anyone. I deleted it along with its accessor and mutator [G9].</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also deleted the degenerate default constructor at line 213 [G12]. The compiler will generate it for us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We can skip over the isValidWeekdayCode method (lines 216–238) because we deleted it when we created the Day enumeration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This brings us to the stringToWeekdayCode method (lines 242–270). Javadocs that don’t add much to the method signature are just clutter [C3],[G12]. The only value this Javadoc adds is the description of the -1 return value. However, because we changed to the Day enumeration, the comment is actually wrong [C2]. The method now throws an IllegalArgumentException. So I deleted the Javadoc.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also deleted all the final keywords in arguments and variable declarations. As far as I could tell, they added no real value but did add to the clutter [G12]. Eliminating final flies in the face of some conventional wisdom. For example, Robert Simmons6 strongly recommends us to “. . . spread final all over your code.” Clearly I disagree. I think that there are a few good uses for final, such as the occasional final constant, but otherwise the keyword adds little value and creates a lot of clutter. Perhaps I feel this way because the kinds of errors that final might catch are already caught by the unit tests I write.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn’t care for the duplicate if statements [G5] inside the for loop (line 259 and line 263), so I connected them into a single if statement using the || operator. I also used the Day enumeration to direct the for loop and made a few other cosmetic changes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It occurred to me that this method does not really belong in DayDate. It’s really the parse function of Day. So I moved it into the Day enumeration. However, that made the Day 6.</p>

<p class="calibre1">277</p>
<p class="calibre1">enumeration pretty large. Because the concept of Day does not depend on DayDate, I moved the Day enumeration outside of the DayDate class into its own source file [G13].</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also moved the next function, weekdayCodeToString (lines 272–286) into the Day enumeration and called it toString.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public enum Day {</p>
<p class="calibre1">MONDAY(Calendar.MONDAY),</p>
<p class="calibre1">TUESDAY(Calendar.TUESDAY),</p>
<p class="calibre1">WEDNESDAY(Calendar.WEDNESDAY),s</p>
<p class="calibre1">THURSDAY(Calendar.THURSDAY),</p>
<p class="calibre1">FRIDAY(Calendar.FRIDAY),</p>
<p class="calibre1">SATURDAY(Calendar.SATURDAY),</p>
<p class="calibre1">SUNDAY(Calendar.SUNDAY);</p>
<p class="calibre1">public final int index;</p>
<p class="calibre1">private static DateFormatSymbols dateSymbols = new DateFormatSymbols(); Day(int day) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">index = day;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static Day make(int index) throws IllegalArgumentException {</p>
<p class="calibre1">for (Day d : Day.values())</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (d.index == index)</p>
<p class="calibre1">return d;</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw new IllegalArgumentException(</p>
<p class="calibre1">String.format("Illegal day index: %d.", index));</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static Day parse(String s) throws IllegalArgumentException {</p>
<p class="calibre1">String[] shortWeekdayNames =</p>
<p class="calibre1">dateSymbols.getShortWeekdays();</p>
<p class="calibre1">String[] weekDayNames =</p>
<p class="calibre1">dateSymbols.getWeekdays();</p>
<p class="calibre1">s = s.trim();</p>
<p class="calibre1">for (Day day : Day.values()) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(shortWeekdayNames[day.index]) ||</p>
<p class="calibre1">s.equalsIgnoreCase(weekDayNames[day.index])) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return day;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw new IllegalArgumentException(</p>
<p class="calibre1">String.format("%s is not a valid weekday string", s));</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public String toString() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return dateSymbols.getWeekdays()[index];</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two getMonths functions (lines 288–316). The first calls the second. The second is never called by anyone but the first. Therefore, I collapsed the two into one and vastly simplified them [G9],[G12],[F4]. Finally, I changed the name to be a bit more self-descriptive [N1].</p>
