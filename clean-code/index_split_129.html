<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_256">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">This is not an activity of malice. Nor do I think that I am so much better than David that I somehow have a right to pass judgment on his code. Indeed, if you were to find some of my code, I’m sure you could find plenty of things to complain about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, this is not an activity of nastiness or arrogance. What I am about to do is nothing more and nothing less than a professional review. It is something that we should all be comfortable doing. And it is something we should welcome when it is done for us. It is only through critiques like these that we will learn. Doctors do it. Pilots do it. Lawyers do it. And we programmers need to learn how to do it too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One more thing about David Gilbert: David is more than just a good programmer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">David had the courage and good will to offer his code to the community at large for free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He placed it out in the open for all to see and invited public usage and public scrutiny. This was well done!</p>
<p class="calibre1">SerialDate (Listing B-1, page 349) is a class that represents a date in Java. Why have a class that represents a date, when Java already has java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar, and others? The author wrote this class in response to a pain that I have often felt myself. The comment in his opening Javadoc (line 67) explains it well. We could quibble about his intention, but I have certainly had to deal with this issue, and I welcome a class that is about dates instead of times.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">First, Make It Work</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are some unit tests in a class named SerialDateTests (Listing B-2, page 366). The tests all pass. Unfortunately a quick inspection of the tests shows that they don’t test everything [T1]. For example, doing a “Find Usages” search on the method MonthCodeToQuarter (line 334) indicates that it is not used [F4]. Therefore, the unit tests don’t test it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I fired up Clover to see what the unit tests covered and what they didn’t. Clover reported that the unit tests executed only 91 of the 185 executable statements in SerialDate (~50 percent) [T2]. The coverage map looks like a patchwork quilt, with big gobs of unex-ecuted code littered all through the class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was my goal to completely understand and also refactor this class. I couldn’t do that without much greater test coverage. So I wrote my own suite of completely independent unit tests (Listing B-4, page 374).</p>
<p class="calibre1">As you look through these tests, you will note that many of them are commented out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These tests didn’t pass. They represent behavior that I think SerialDate should have. So as I refactor SerialDate, I’ll be working to make these tests pass too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with some of the tests commented out, Clover reports that the new unit tests are executing 170 (92 percent) out of the 185 executable statements. This is pretty good, and I think we’ll be able to get this number higher.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first few commented-out tests (lines 23-63) were a bit of conceit on my part. The program was not designed to pass these tests, but the behavior seemed obvious [G2] to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a><b class="calibre3">First, Make It Work</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">269</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m not sure why the testWeekdayCodeToString method was written in the first place, but because it is there, it seems obvious that it should not be case sensitive. Writing these tests was trivial [T3]. Making them pass was even easier; I just changed lines 259 and 263 to use equalsIgnoreCase.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I left the tests at line 32 and line 45 commented out because it’s not clear to me that the “tues” and “thurs” abbreviations ought to be supported.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tests on line 153 and line 154 don’t pass. Clearly, they should [G2]. We can easily fix this, and the tests on line 163 through line 213, by making the following changes to the stringToMonthCode function.</p>
<p class="calibre1">457         if ((result &lt; 1) || (result &gt; 12)) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">result = -1;</p>
<p class="calibre1">458             for (int i = 0; i &lt; monthNames.length; i++) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">459                 if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(shortMonthNames[i])) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">460                     result = i + 1;</p>
<p class="calibre1">461                     break;</p>
<p class="calibre1">462                 }</p>
<p class="calibre1">463                 if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(monthNames[i])) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">464                     result = i + 1;</p>
<p class="calibre1">465                     break;</p>
<p class="calibre1">466                 }</p>
<p class="calibre1">467             }</p>
<p class="calibre1">468         }</p>
<p class="calibre1">The commented test on line 318 exposes a bug in the getFollowingDayOfWeek method (line 672). December 25th, 2004, was a Saturday. The following Saturday was January 1st, 2005. However, when we run the test, we see that getFollowingDayOfWeek returns December 25th as the Saturday that follows December 25th. Clearly, this is wrong [G3],[T1]. We see the problem in line 685. It is a typical boundary condition error [T5]. It should read as follows: 685         if (baseDOW &gt;= targetWeekday) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is interesting to note that this function was the target of an earlier repair. The change history (line 43) shows that “bugs” were fixed in getPreviousDayOfWeek, getFollowingDayOfWeek, and getNearestDayOfWeek [T6].</p>
<p class="calibre1">The testGetNearestDayOfWeek unit test (line 329), which tests the getNearestDayOfWeek method (line 705), did not start out as long and exhaustive as it currently is. I added a lot of test cases to it because my initial test cases did not all pass [T6]. You can see the pattern of failure by looking at which test cases are commented out. That pattern is revealing [T7].</p>
<p class="calibre1">It shows that the algorithm fails if the nearest day is in the future. Clearly there is some kind of boundary condition error [T5].</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pattern of test coverage reported by Clover is also interesting [T8]. Line 719</p>
<p class="calibre1">never gets executed! This means that the if statement in line 718 is always false. Sure enough, a look at the code shows that this must be true. The adjust variable is always negative and so cannot be greater or equal to 4. So this algorithm is just wrong.</p>
