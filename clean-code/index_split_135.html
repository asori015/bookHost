<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_268">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">int lastDayOfResultMonth = lastDayOfMonth(resultMonth, resultYear); int resultDay = Math.min(getDayOfMonth(), lastDayOfResultMonth); return DayDateFactory.makeDate(resultDay, resultMonth, resultYear);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The addYears function (lines 604–626) provides no surprises over the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public DayDate plusYears(int years) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int resultYear = getYear() + years;</p>
<p class="calibre1">int lastDayOfMonthInResultYear = lastDayOfMonth(getMonth(), resultYear); int resultDay = Math.min(getDayOfMonth(), lastDayOfMonthInResultYear); return DayDateFactory.makeDate(resultDay, getMonth(), resultYear); }</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a little itch at the back of my mind that is bothering me about changing these methods from static to instance. Does the expression date.addDays(5) make it clear that the date object does not change and that a new instance of DayDate is returned?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or does it erroneously imply that we are adding five days to the date object? You  might not think that is a big problem, but a bit of code that looks like the following can be very deceiving [G20].</p>
<p class="calibre1">DayDate date = DateFactory.makeDate(5, Month.DECEMBER, 1952);</p>
<p class="calibre1">date.addDays(7); // bump date by one week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone reading this code would very likely just accept that addDays is changing the date object. So we need a name that breaks this ambiguity [N4]. So I changed the names to plusDays and plusMonths. It seems to me that the intent of the method is captured nicely by DayDate date = oldDate.plusDays(5); whereas the following doesn’t read fluidly enough for a reader to simply accept that the date object is changed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">date.plusDays(5);</p>
<p class="calibre1">The algorithms continue to get more interesting. getPreviousDayOfWeek (lines 628–</p>
<p class="calibre1">660) works but is a bit complicated. After some thought about what was really going on</p>
<p class="calibre1">[G21], I was able to simplify it and use EXPLAINING  TEMPORARY  VARIABLES [G19] to make it clearer. I also changed it from a static method to an instance method [G18], and got rid of the duplicate instance method [G5] (lines 997–1008).</p>
<p class="calibre1">public DayDate getPreviousDayOfWeek(Day targetDayOfWeek) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int offsetToTarget = targetDayOfWeek.index - getDayOfWeek().index; if (offsetToTarget &gt;= 0)</p>
<p class="calibre1">offsetToTarget -= 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">return plusDays(offsetToTarget);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The exact same analysis and result occurred for getFollowingDayOfWeek (lines 662–693).</p>
<p class="calibre1">public DayDate getFollowingDayOfWeek(Day targetDayOfWeek) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int offsetToTarget = targetDayOfWeek.index - getDayOfWeek().index; if (offsetToTarget &lt;= 0)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a><b class="calibre3">Then Make It Right</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">281</p>
<p class="calibre1">offsetToTarget += 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">return plusDays(offsetToTarget);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next function is getNearestDayOfWeek (lines 695–726), which we corrected back on page 270. But the changes I made back then aren’t consistent with the current pattern in the last two functions [G11]. So I made it consistent and used some EXPLAINING TEMPORARY VARIABLES [G19] to clarify the algorithm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public DayDate getNearestDayOfWeek(final Day targetDay) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">int offsetToThisWeeksTarget = targetDay.index - getDayOfWeek().index; int offsetToFutureTarget = (offsetToThisWeeksTarget + 7) % 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">int offsetToPreviousTarget = offsetToFutureTarget - 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (offsetToFutureTarget &gt; 3)</p>
<p class="calibre1">return plusDays(offsetToPreviousTarget);</p>
<p class="calibre1">else</p>
<p class="calibre1">return plusDays(offsetToFutureTarget);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The getEndOfCurrentMonth method (lines 728–740) is a little strange because it is an instance method that envies [G14] its own class by taking a DayDate argument. I made it a true instance method and clarified a few names.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public DayDate getEndOfMonth() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">Month month = getMonth();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int year = getYear();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int lastDay = lastDayOfMonth(month, year);</p>
<p class="calibre1">return DayDateFactory.makeDate(lastDay, month, year);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Refactoring  weekInMonthToString (lines 742–761) turned out to be very interesting indeed. Using the refactoring tools of my IDE, I first moved the method to the WeekInMonth enum that I created back on page 275. Then I renamed the method to toString. Next, I changed it from a static method to an instance method. All the tests still passed. (Can you guess where I am going?) Next, I deleted the method entirely! Five asserts failed (lines 411–415, Listing B-4, page 374). I changed these lines to use the names of the enumerators (FIRST, SECOND, . . .). All the tests passed. Can you see why? Can you also see why each of these steps was necessary? The refactoring tool made sure that all previous callers of weekInMonthToString now called toString on the weekInMonth enumerator because all enumerators implement toString to simply return their names. . . .</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, I was a bit too clever. As elegant as that wonderful chain of refactor-ings was, I finally realized that the only users of this function were the tests I had just modified, so I deleted the tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! So after determining that nobody other than the tests called relativeToString (lines 765–781), I simply deleted the function and its tests.</p>
