<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 10-1 (continued)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Too Many Responsibilities</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">public void setAçowDragging(boolean allowDragging)</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean allowDragging()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public boolean isCustomizing()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void setTitle(String title)</p>
<p class="calibre1">public IdeMenuBar getIdeMenuBar()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void showHelper(MetaObject metaObject, String propertyName)</p>
<p class="calibre1">// ... many non-public methods follow ...</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what if SuperDashboard contained only the methods shown in Listing 10-2?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 10-2 </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Small Enough? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">public class SuperDashboard extends JFrame implements MetaDataUser public Component getLastFocusedComponent()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void setLastFocused(Component lastFocused)</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getMajorVersionNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getMinorVersionNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getBuildNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five methods isn’t too much, is it? In this case it is because despite its small number of methods, SuperDashboard has too many  <i class="calibre4">responsibilities</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of a class should describe what responsibilities it fulfills. In fact, naming is probably the first way of helping determine class size. If we cannot derive a concise name for a class, then it’s likely too large. The more ambiguous the class name, the more likely it has too many responsibilities. For example, class names including weasel words like  Processor or Manager or Super often hint at unfortunate aggregation of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words, without using the words “if,” “and,” “or,” or “but.” How would we describe the SuperDashboard? “The SuperDashboard provides access to the component that last held the focus, and it also allows us to track the version and build numbers.” The first “and” is a hint that SuperDashboard has too many responsibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">The Single Responsibility Principle</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)2 states that a class or module should have one, and only one,  <i class="calibre4">reason to change</i>. This principle gives us both a definition of responsibility, and a guidelines for class size. Classes should have one responsibility—one reason to change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can read much more about this principle in [PPP].</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a><b class="calibre3">Classes Should Be Small! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">139</p>
<p class="calibre1">The seemingly small SuperDashboard class in Listing 10-2 has two reasons to change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, it tracks version information that would seemingly need to be updated every time the software gets shipped. Second, it manages Java Swing components (it is a derivative of JFrame, the Swing representation of a top-level GUI window). No doubt we’ll want to update the version number if we change any of the Swing code, but the converse isn’t necessarily true: We might change the version information based on changes to other code in the system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying to identify responsibilities (reasons to change) often helps us recognize and create better abstractions in our code. We can easily extract all three SuperDashboard methods that deal with version information into a separate class named Version. (See Listing 10-3.) The Version class is a construct that has a high potential for reuse in other applications!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 10-3 </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A single-responsibility class</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">public class Version {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getMajorVersionNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getMinorVersionNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int getBuildNumber()</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">SRP is one of the more important concept in OO design. It’s also one of the simpler concepts to understand and adhere to. Yet oddly, SRP is often the most abused class design principle. We regularly encounter classes that do far too many things. Why?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting software to work and making software clean are two very different activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of us have limited room in our heads, so we focus on getting our code to work more than organization and cleanliness. This is wholly appropriate. Maintaining a separation of concerns is just as important in our programming  <i class="calibre4">activities</i> as it is in our programs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem is that too many of us think that we are done once the program works.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We fail to switch to the  <i class="calibre4">other </i> concern of organization and cleanliness. We move on to the next problem rather than going back and breaking the overstuffed classes into decoupled units with single responsibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, many developers fear that a large number of small, single-purpose classes makes it more difficult to understand the bigger picture. They are concerned that they must navigate from class to class in order to figure out how a larger piece of work gets accomplished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, a system with many small classes has no more moving parts than a system with a few large classes. There is just as much to learn in the system with a few large classes. So the question is: Do you want your tools organized into toolboxes with many small drawers each containing well-defined and well-labeled components? Or do you want a few drawers that you just toss everything into?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every sizable system will contain a large amount of logic and complexity. The primary goal in managing such complexity is to  <i class="calibre4">organize </i> it so that a developer knows where</p>
