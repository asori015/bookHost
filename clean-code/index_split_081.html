<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_160">Chapter 11: Systems</h2>
<p class="calibre1">We all know it is best to give responsibilities to the most qualified persons. We often forget that it is also best to  <i class="calibre4">postpone decisions until the last possible moment</i>. This isn’t lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A premature decision is a decision made with suboptimal knowledge. We will have that much less customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with our implementation choices if we decide too soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The agility provided by a POJO system with modularized concerns allows us to make optimal, just-in-time decisions, based on the most recent knowledge. The complexity of these</i> <i class="calibre4">decisions is also reduced. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Use Standards Wisely, When They Add  <i class="calibre4">Demonstrable </i></b><b class="calibre3">Value</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Building construction is a marvel to watch because of the pace at which new buildings are built (even in the dead of winter) and because of the extraordinary designs that are possible with today’s technology. Construction is a mature industry with highly optimized parts, methods, and standards that have evolved under pressure for centuries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many teams used the EJB2 architecture because it was a standard, even when lighter-weight and more straightforward designs would have been sufficient. I have seen teams become obsessed with various  <i class="calibre4">strongly hyped </i> standards and lose focus on implementing value for their customers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Standards make it easier to reuse ideas and components, recruit people with relevant experience, encapsulate good ideas, and wire components together. However, the process of</i> <i class="calibre4">creating standards can sometimes take too long for industry to wait, and some standards</i> <i class="calibre4">lose touch with the real needs of the adopters they are intended to serve. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Systems Need Domain-Specific Languages</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Building construction, like most domains, has developed a rich language with a vocabu-lary, idioms, and patterns21 that convey essential information clearly and concisely. In software, there has been renewed interest recently in creating  <i class="calibre4">Domain-Specific Languages</i> (DSLs),22 which are separate, small scripting languages or APIs in standard languages that permit code to be written so that it reads like a structured form of prose that a domain expert might write.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A good DSL minimizes the “communication gap” between a domain concept and the code that implements it, just as agile practices optimize the communications within a team and with the project’s stakeholders. If you are implementing domain logic in the 21. The work of [Alexander] has been particularly influential on the software community.</p>
<p class="calibre1">22. See, for example, [DSL]. [JMock] is a good example of a Java API that creates a DSL.</p>

<p class="calibre1">same language that a domain expert uses, there is less risk that you will incorrectly translate the domain into the implementation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">DSLs, when used effectively, raise the abstraction level above code idioms and design patterns. They allow the developer to reveal the intent of the code at the appropriate level of abstraction.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Domain-Specific Languages allow all levels of abstraction and all domains in the application to be expressed as POJOs, from high-level policy to low-level details. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Systems must be clean too. An invasive architecture overwhelms the domain logic and impacts agility. When the domain logic is obscured, quality suffers because bugs find it easier to hide and stories become harder to implement. If agility is compromised, productivity suffers and the benefits of TDD are lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At all levels of abstraction, the intent should be clear. This will only happen if you write POJOs and you use aspect-like mechanisms to incorporate other implementation concerns noninvasively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether you are designing systems or individual modules, never forget to  <i class="calibre4">use the</i> <i class="calibre4">simplest thing that can possibly work</i>.</p>
