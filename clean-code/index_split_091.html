<p class="calibre1">threads to be easily tuned. Consider allowing it to change while the system is running.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider allowing self-tuning based on throughput and system utilization.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Run with More Threads Than Processors</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Things happen when the system switches between tasks. To encourage task swapping, run with more threads than processors or cores. The more frequently your tasks swap, the more likely you’ll encounter code that is missing a critical section or causes deadlock.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Run on Different Platforms</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of 2007 we developed a course on concurrent programming. The course development ensued primarily under OS X. The class was presented using Windows XP</p>
<p class="calibre1">running under a VM. Tests written to demonstrate failure conditions did not fail as frequently in an XP environment as they did running on OS X.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In all cases the code under test was known to be incorrect. This just reinforced the fact that different operating systems have different threading policies, each of which impacts the code’s execution. Multithreaded code behaves differently in different environments.16</p>
<p class="calibre1">You should run your tests in every potential deployment environment.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Recommendation</b>:  <i class="calibre4">Run your threaded code on all target platforms early and often. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Instrument Your Code to Try and Force Failures</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is normal for flaws in concurrent code to hide. Simple tests often don’t expose them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, they often hide during normal processing. They might show up once every few hours, or days, or weeks!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason that threading bugs can be infrequent, sporadic, and hard to repeat, is that only a very few pathways out of the many thousands of possible pathways through a vul-nerable section actually fail. So the probability that a failing pathway is taken can be startlingly low. This makes detection and debugging very difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How might you increase your chances of catching such rare occurrences? You can instrument your code and force it to run in different orderings by adding calls to methods like Object.wait(), Object.sleep(), Object.yield() and Object.priority().</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of these methods can affect the order of execution, thereby increasing the odds of detecting a flaw. It’s better when broken code fails as early and as often as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two options for code instrumentation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Hand-coded</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Automated</p>
<p class="calibre1">16.  Did you know that the threading model in Java does not guarantee preemptive threading? Modern OS’s support preemptive threading, so you get that “for free.” Even so, it not guaranteed by the JVM.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a><b class="calibre3">Testing Threaded Code</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">189</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Hand-Coded</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">You can insert calls to wait(), sleep(), yield(), and priority() in your code by hand. It might be just the thing to do when you’re testing a particularly thorny piece of code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is an example of doing just that:</p>
<p class="calibre1">public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if(hasNext()) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">String url = urlGenerator.next();</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thread.yield(); // inserted for testing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">updateHasNext();</p>
<p class="calibre1">return url;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">return null;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The inserted call to yield() will change the execution pathways taken by the code and possibly cause the code to fail where it did not fail before. If the code does break, it was not because you added a call to yield().17 Rather, your code was broken and this simply made the failure evident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are many problems with this approach:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• You have to manually find appropriate places to do this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• How do you know where to put the call and what kind of call to use?</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Leaving such code in a production environment unnecessarily slows the code down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• It’s a shotgun approach. You may or may not find flaws. Indeed, the odds aren’t with you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What we need is a way to do this during testing but not in production. We also need to easily mix up configurations between different runs, which results in increased chances of finding errors in the aggregate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, if we divide our system up into POJOs that know nothing of threading and classes that control the threading, it will be easier to find appropriate places to instrument the code. Moreover, we could create many different test jigs that invoke the POJOs under different regimes of calls to sleep, yield, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Automated</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">You could use tools like an Aspect-Oriented Framework, CGLIB, or ASM to programmatically instrument your code. For example, you could use a class with a single method: public class ThreadJigglePoint {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static void jiggle() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">17. This is not strictly the case. Since the JVM does not guarantee preemptive threading, a particular algorithm might always work on an OS that does not preempt threads. The reverse is also possible but for different reasons.</p>
