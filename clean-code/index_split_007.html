<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_12">Chapter 1: Clean Code</h2>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . pretty much what you expected.” When was the last time you saw a module that was pretty much what you expected? Isn’t it more likely that the modules you look at will be puzzling, complicated, tangled? Isn’t misdirection the rule? Aren’t you used to flailing about trying to grab and hold the threads of reasoning that spew forth from the whole system and weave their way through the module you are reading? When was the last time you read through some code and nodded your head the way you might have nodded your head at Ward’s statement?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ward expects that when you read clean code you won’t be surprised at all. Indeed, you won’t even expend much effort. You will read it, and it will be pretty much what you expected. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling. Each module will set the stage for the next. Each tells you how the next will be written. Programs that are  <i class="calibre4">that </i> clean are so profoundly well written that you don’t even notice it. The designer makes it look ridicu-lously simple like all exceptional designs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And what about Ward’s notion of beauty? We’ve all railed against the fact that our languages weren’t designed for our problems. But Ward’s statement puts the onus back on us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He says that beautiful code  <i class="calibre4">makes the language look like it was made for the problem</i>! So it’s   <i class="calibre4">our </i> responsibility to make the language look simple! Language bigots everywhere, beware! It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">Schools of Thought</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">What about me (Uncle Bob)? What do I think</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean code is? This book will tell you, in hideous</p>
<p class="calibre1">detail, what I and my compatriots think about</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean code. We will tell you what we think makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">a clean variable name, a clean function, a clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">class, etc. We will present these opinions as abso-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lutes, and we will not apologize for our stridence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To us, at this point in our careers, they  <i class="calibre4">are </i> abso-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lutes. They are  <i class="calibre4">our school of thought </i> about clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Martial artists do not all agree about the best</p>
<p class="calibre1">martial art, or the best technique within a martial</p>
<p class="calibre1">art. Often master martial artists will form their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own schools of thought and gather students to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn from them. So we see  <i class="calibre4">Gracie Jiu Jistu</i>,</p>
<p class="calibre1">founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see  <i class="calibre4">Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu</i>, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We see  <i class="calibre4">Jeet Kune Do</i>, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">We Are Authors</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">13</p>
<p class="calibre1">Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the founder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master’s teaching. Later, as the students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master so they can broaden their knowledge and practice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some eventually go on to refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own schools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of these different schools is absolutely  <i class="calibre4">right</i>. Yet within a particular school we <i class="calibre4">act</i> as though the teachings and techniques  <i class="calibre4">are</i> right. After all, there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider this book a description of the  <i class="calibre4">Object Mentor School of Clean Code</i>. The techniques and teachings within are the way that  <i class="calibre4">we  </i> practice  <i class="calibre4">our </i> art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and professional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial. You will probably not agree with all of them. You might violently disagree with some of them. That’s fine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We can’t claim final authority. On the other hand, the recommendations in this book are things that we have thought long and hard about. We have learned them through decades of experience and repeated trial and error. So whether you agree or disagree, it would be a shame if you did not see, and respect, our point of view.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p8"><b class="calibre3">We Are Authors</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The @author field of a Javadoc tells us who we are. We are authors. And one thing about authors is that they have readers. Indeed, authors are  <i class="calibre4">responsible </i> for communicating well with their readers. The next time you write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who will judge your effort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn’t most of the effort go into writing it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had editors like Emacs that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for an hour and then play back your whole edit session like a high-speed movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other modules!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Bob enters the module. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">He scrolls down to the function needing change. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">He pauses, considering his options. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Oh, he’s scrolling up to the top of the module to check the initialization of a variable. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Now he scrolls back down and begins to type. </i></p>
