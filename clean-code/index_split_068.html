<p class="calibre1">to look to find things and need only understand the directly affected complexity at any given time. In contrast, a system with larger, multipurpose classes always hampers us by insisting we wade through lots of things we don’t need to know right now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To restate the former points for emphasis: We want our systems to be composed of many small classes, not a few large ones. Each small class encapsulates a single responsibility, has a single reason to change, and collaborates with a few others to achieve the desired system behaviors.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Cohesion</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. A class in which each variable is used by each method is maximally cohesive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In general it is neither advisable nor possible to create such maximally cohesive classes; on the other hand, we would like cohesion to be high. When cohesion is high, it means that the methods and variables of the class are co-dependent and hang together as a logical whole.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the implementation of a Stack in Listing 10-4. This is a very cohesive class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the three methods only size() fails to use both the variables.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 10-4 </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Stack.java A cohesive class. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">public class Stack {</p>
<p class="calibre1">private int topOfStack = 0;</p>
<p class="calibre1">List&lt;Integer&gt; elements = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;(); public int size() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">return topOfStack;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void push(int element) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">topOfStack++;</p>
<p class="calibre1">elements.add(element);</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">public int pop() throws PoppedWhenEmpty {</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (topOfStack == 0)</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw new PoppedWhenEmpty();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int element = elements.get(--topOfStack);</p>
<p class="calibre1">elements.remove(topOfStack);</p>
<p class="calibre1">return element;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">The strategy of keeping functions small and keeping parameter lists short can sometimes lead to a proliferation of instance variables that are used by a subset of methods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When this happens, it almost always means that there is at least one other class trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a><b class="calibre3">Classes Should Be Small! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">141</p>
<p class="calibre1">get out of the larger class. You should try to separate the variables and methods into two or more classes such that the new classes are more cohesive.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p13"><b class="calibre3">Maintaining Cohesion Results in Many Small Classes</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just the act of breaking large functions into smaller functions causes a proliferation of classes. Consider a large function with many variables declared within it. Let’s say you want to extract one small part of that function into a separate function. However, the code you want to extract uses four of the variables declared in the function. Must you pass all four of those variables into the new function as arguments?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not at all! If we promoted those four variables to instance variables of the class, then we could extract the code without passing  <i class="calibre4">any </i> variables at all. It would be  <i class="calibre4">easy </i> to break the function up into small pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, this also means that our classes lose cohesion because they accumulate more and more instance variables that exist solely to allow a few functions to share them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But wait! If there are a few functions that want to share certain variables, doesn’t that make them a class in their own right? Of course it does. When classes lose cohesion, split them!</p>
<p class="calibre1">So breaking a large function into many smaller functions often gives us the opportunity to split several smaller classes out as well. This gives our program a much better organization and a more transparent structure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a demonstration of what I mean, let’s use a time-honored example taken from Knuth’s wonderful book  <i class="calibre4">Literate Programming. </i> 3 Listing 10-5 shows a translation into Java of Knuth’s PrintPrimes program. To be fair to Knuth, this is not the program as he wrote it but rather as it was output by his WEB tool. I’m using it because it makes a great starting place for breaking up a big function into many smaller functions and classes.</p>
