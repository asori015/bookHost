<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Listing 8-1 (continued)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LogTest.java</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">@Test</p>
<p class="calibre1">public void addAppenderWithoutStream() {</p>
<p class="calibre1">logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(</p>
<p class="calibre1">new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n")));</p>
<p class="calibre1">logger.info("addAppenderWithoutStream");</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now we know how to get a simple console logger initialized, and we can encapsulate that knowledge into our own logger class so that the rest of our application is isolated from the log4j boundary interface.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p12"><b class="calibre3">Learning Tests Are Better Than Free</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The learning tests end up costing nothing. We had to learn the API anyway, and writing those tests was an easy and isolated way to get that knowledge. The learning tests were precise experiments that helped increase our understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment. When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning tests verify that the third-party packages we are using work the way we expect them to. Once integrated, there are no guarantees that the third-party code will stay compatible with our needs. The original authors will have pressures to change their code to meet new needs of their own. They will fix bugs and add new capabilities. With each release comes new risk. If the third-party package changes in some way incompatible with our tests, we will find out right away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether you need the learning provided by the learning tests or not, a clean boundary should be supported by a set of outbound tests that exercise the interface the same way the production code does. Without these  <i class="calibre4">boundary tests </i> to ease the migration, we might be tempted to stay with the old version longer than we should.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p12"><b class="calibre3">Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is another kind of boundary, one that separates the known from the unknown. There are often places in the code where our knowledge seems to drop off the edge. Sometimes what is on the other side of the boundary is unknowable (at least right now). Sometimes we choose to look no farther than the boundary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A number of years back I was part of a team developing software for a radio communications system. There was a subsystem, the “Transmitter,” that we knew little about, and the people responsible for the subsystem had not gotten to the point of defining their interface. We did not want to be blocked, so we started our work far away from the unknown part of the code.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">119</p>
<p class="calibre1">We had a pretty good idea of where our world ended and the new world began. As we worked, we sometimes bumped up against this boundary. Though mists and clouds of ignorance obscured our view beyond the boundary, our work made us aware of what we <i class="calibre4">wanted</i> the boundary interface to be. We wanted to tell the transmitter something like this: <i class="calibre4">Key the transmitter on the provided frequency and emit an analog representation of the</i> <i class="calibre4">data coming from this stream. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We had no idea how that would be done because the API had not been designed yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So we decided to work out the details later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To keep from being blocked, we defined our own interface. We called it something catchy, like Transmitter. We gave it a method called transmit that took a frequency and a data stream. This was the interface we  <i class="calibre4">wished</i> we had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One good thing about writing the interface we wish we had is that it’s under our control. This helps keep client code more readable and focused on what it is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Figure 8-2, you can see that we insulated the CommunicationsController classes from the transmitter API (which was out of our control and undefined). By using our own application specific interface, we kept our CommunicationsController code clean and expressive. Once the transmitter API was defined, we wrote the TransmitterAdapter to bridge the gap. The ADAPTER2 encapsulated the interaction with the API and provides a single place to change when the API evolves.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Predicting the transmitter</p>
<p class="calibre1">This design also gives us a very convenient seam3 in the code for testing. Using a suitable FakeTransmitter, we can test the CommunicationsController classes. We can also create boundary tests once we have the TransmitterAPI that make sure we are using the API correctly.</p>
