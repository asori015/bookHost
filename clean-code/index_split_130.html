<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_258">Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</h2>
<p class="calibre1">The right algorithm is shown below:</p>
<p class="calibre1">int delta = targetDOW - base.getDayOfWeek();</p>
<p class="calibre1">int positiveDelta = delta + 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">int adjust = positiveDelta % 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">if (adjust &gt; 3)</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjust -= 7;</p>
<p class="calibre1">return SerialDate.addDays(adjust, base);</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the tests at line 417 and line 429 can be made to pass simply by throwing an IllegalArgumentException instead of returning an error string from weekInMonthToString and relativeToString.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With these changes all the unit tests pass, and I believe SerialDate now works. So now it’s time to make it “right.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">Then Make It Right</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We are going to walk from the top to the bottom of SerialDate, improving it as we go along. Although you won’t see this in the discussion, I will be running all of the JCommon unit tests, including my improved unit test for SerialDate, after every change I make. So rest assured that every change you see here works for all of JCommon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting at line 1, we see a ream of comments with license information, copyrights, authors, and change history. I acknowledge that there are certain legalities that need to be addressed, and so the copyrights and licenses must stay. On the other hand, the change history is a leftover from the 1960s. We have source code control tools that do this for us now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This history should be deleted [C1].</p>
<p class="calibre1">The import list starting at line 61 could be shortened by using java.text.* and java.util.*. [J1]</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wince at the HTML formatting in the Javadoc (line 67). Having a source file with more than one language in it troubles me. This comment has  <i class="calibre4">four </i> languages in it: Java, English, Javadoc, and html [G1]. With that many languages in use, it’s hard to keep things straight. For example, the nice positioning of line 71 and line 72 are lost when the Javadoc is generated, and yet who wants to see &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; in the source code? A better strategy might be to just surround the whole comment with &lt;pre&gt; so that the formatting that is apparent in the source code is preserved within the Javadoc.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Line 86 is the class declaration. Why is this class named SerialDate? What is the significance of the world “serial”? Is it because the class is derived from Serializable? That doesn’t seem likely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An even better solution would have been for Javadoc to present all comments as preformatted, so that comments appear the same in both code and document.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a><b class="calibre3">Then Make It Right</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">271</p>
<p class="calibre1">I won’t keep you guessing. I know why (or at least I think I know why) the word</p>
<p class="calibre1">“serial” was used. The clue is in the constants SERIAL_LOWER_BOUND and SERIAL_UPPER_BOUND on line 98 and line 101. An even better clue is in the comment that begins on line 830. This class is named SerialDate because it is implemented using a “serial number,” which happens to be the number of days since December 30th, 1899.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have two problems with this. First, the term “serial number” is not really correct.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This may be a quibble, but the representation is more of a relative offset than a serial number. The term “serial number” has more to do with product identification markers than dates. So I don’t find this name particularly descriptive [N1]. A more descriptive term might be “ordinal.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second problem is more significant. The name SerialDate implies an implementation. This class is an abstract class. There is no need to imply anything at all about the implementation. Indeed, there is good reason to hide the implementation! So I find this name to be at the wrong level of abstraction [N2]. In my opinion, the name of this class should simply be Date.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, there are already too many classes in the Java library named Date, so this is probably not the best name to choose. Because this class is all about days, instead of time, I considered naming it Day, but this name is also heavily used in other places. In the end, I chose DayDate as the best compromise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From now on in this discussion I will use the term DayDate. I leave it to you to remember that the listings you are looking at still use SerialDate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I understand why DayDate inherits from Comparable and Serializable. But why does it inherit from MonthConstants? The class MonthConstants (Listing B-3, page 372) is just a bunch of static final constants that define the months. Inheriting from classes with constants is an old trick that Java programmers used so that they could avoid using expressions like MonthConstants.January, but it’s a bad idea [J2]. MonthConstants should really be an enum.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public abstract class DayDate implements Comparable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Serializable {</p>
<p class="calibre1">public static enum Month {</p>
<p class="calibre1">JANUARY(1),</p>
<p class="calibre1">FEBRUARY(2),</p>
<p class="calibre1">MARCH(3),</p>
<p class="calibre1">APRIL(4),</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAY(5),</p>
<p class="calibre1">JUNE(6),</p>
<p class="calibre1">JULY(7),</p>
<p class="calibre1">AUGUST(8),</p>
<p class="calibre1">SEPTEMBER(9),</p>
<p class="calibre1">OCTOBER(10),</p>
<p class="calibre1">NOVEMBER(11),</p>
<p class="calibre1">DECEMBER(12);</p>
<p class="calibre1">Month(int index) {</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.index = index;</p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
