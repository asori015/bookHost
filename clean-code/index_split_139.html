<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">Functions</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">F1:  <i class="calibre4">Too Many Arguments</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Functions should have a small number of arguments. No argument is best, followed by one, two, and three. More than three is very questionable and should be avoided with prejudice. (See “Function Arguments” on page 40.) <a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">F2:  <i class="calibre4">Output Arguments</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Output arguments are counterintuitive. Readers expect arguments to be inputs, not outputs. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of the object it is called on. (See “Output Arguments” on page 45.) <a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">F3:  <i class="calibre4">Flag Arguments</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one thing. They are confusing and should be eliminated. (See “Flag Arguments” on page 41.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">F4:  <i class="calibre4">Dead Function</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Methods that are never called should be discarded. Keeping dead code around is wasteful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t be afraid to delete the function. Remember, your source code control system still remembers it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">General</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G1:  <i class="calibre4">Multiple Languages in One Source File</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Today’s modern programming environments make it possible to put many different languages into a single source file. For example, a Java source file might contain snippets of XML, HTML, YAML, JavaDoc, English, JavaScript, and so on. For another example, in addition to HTML a JSP file might contain Java, a tag library syntax, English comments, Javadocs, XML, JavaScript, and so forth. This is confusing at best and carelessly sloppy at worst.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ideal is for a source file to contain one, and only one, language. Realistically, we will probably have to use more than one. But we should take pains to minimize both the number and extent of extra languages in our source files.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G2:  <i class="calibre4">Obvious Behavior Is Unimplemented</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Following “The Principle of Least Surprise,”2 any function or class should implement the behaviors that another programmer could reasonably expect. For example, consider a function that translates the name of a day to an enum that represents the day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or “The Principle of Least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Astonishment”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle_of_least_astonishment</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a><b class="calibre3">General</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">289</p>
<p class="calibre1">Day day = DayDate.StringToDay(String dayName);</p>
<p class="calibre1">We would expect the string "Monday" to be translated to Day.MONDAY. We would also expect the common abbreviations to be translated, and we would expect the function to ignore case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When an obvious behavior is not implemented, readers and users of the code can no longer depend on their intuition about function names. They lose their trust in the original author and must fall back on reading the details of the code.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G3:  <i class="calibre4">Incorrect Behavior at the Boundaries</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems obvious to say that code should behave correctly. The problem is that we seldom realize just how complicated correct behavior is. Developers often write functions that they think will work, and then trust their intuition rather than going to the effort to prove that their code works in all the corner and boundary cases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no replacement for due diligence. Every boundary condition, every corner case, every quirk and exception represents something that can confound an elegant and intuitive algorithm.  <i class="calibre4">Don’t rely on your intuition</i>. Look for every boundary condition and write a test for it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G4:  <i class="calibre4">Overridden Safeties</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chernobyl melted down because the plant manager overrode each of the safety mechanisms one by one. The safeties were making it inconvenient to run an experiment. The result was that the experiment did not get run, and the world saw it’s first major civilian nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is risky to override safeties. Exerting manual control over serialVersionUID may be necessary, but it is always risky. Turning off certain compiler warnings (or all warnings!) may help you get the build to succeed, but at the risk of endless debugging sessions. Turning off failing tests and telling yourself you’ll get them to pass later is as bad as pretending your credit cards are free money.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p15"><b class="calibre3">G5:  <i class="calibre4">Duplication</i></b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one of the most important rules in this book, and you should take it very seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Virtually every author who writes about software design mentions this rule. Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt called it the DRY3 principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Kent Beck made it one of the core principles of Extreme Programming and called it: “Once, and only once.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron Jeffries ranks this rule second, just below getting all the tests to pass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every time you see duplication in the code, it represents a missed opportunity for abstraction. That duplication could probably become a subroutine or perhaps another class outright. By folding the duplication into such an abstraction, you increase the vocab-ulary of the language of your design. Other programmers can use the abstract facilities 3.</p>
