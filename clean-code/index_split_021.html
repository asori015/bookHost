<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_40">Chapter 3: Functions</h2>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Dyadic Functions</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function. For example, writeField(name) is easier to understand than writeField(output-Stream, name).10</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the meaning of both is clear, the first glides past the eye, easily depositing its meaning. The second requires a short pause until we learn to ignore the first parameter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And  <i class="calibre4">that</i>, of course, eventually results in problems because we should never ignore any part of code. The parts we ignore are where the bugs will hide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are times, of course, where two arguments are appropriate. For example, Point p = new Point(0,0); is perfectly reasonable. Cartesian points naturally take two arguments. Indeed, we’d be very surprised to see new Point(0). However, the two arguments in this case  <i class="calibre4">are ordered components of a single value! </i> Whereas output-Stream and name have neither a natural cohesion, nor a natural ordering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even obvious dyadic functions like assertEquals(expected, actual) are problematic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How many times have you put the actual where the expected should be? The two arguments have no natural ordering. The expected, actual ordering is a convention that requires practice to learn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dyads aren’t evil, and you will certainly have to write them. However, you should be aware that they come at a cost and should take advantage of what mechanims may be available to you to convert them into monads. For example, you might make the writeField method a member of outputStream so that you can say outputStream.</p>
<p class="calibre1">writeField(name). Or you might make the outputStream a member variable of the current class so that you don’t have to pass it. Or you might extract a new class like FieldWriter that takes the outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Triads</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Functions that take three arguments are significantly harder to understand than dyads. The issues of ordering, pausing, and ignoring are more than doubled. I suggest you think very carefully before creating a triad.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, consider the common overload of assertEquals that takes three arguments: assertEquals(message, expected, actual). How many times have you read the message and thought it was the expected? I have stumbled and paused over that particular triad many times. In fact,  <i class="calibre4">every time I see it, </i> I do a double-take and then learn to ignore the message.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, here is a triad that is not quite so insidious: assertEquals(1.0, amount, .001). Although this still requires a double-take, it’s one that’s worth taking. It’s always good to be reminded that equality of floating point values is a relative thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">10. I just finished refactoring a module that used the dyadic form. I was able to make the outputStream a field of the class and convert all the writeField calls to the monadic form. The result was much cleaner.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><b class="calibre3">Function Arguments</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">43</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Argument Objects</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely that some of those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their own. Consider, for example, the difference between the two following declarations: Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects out of them may seem like cheating, but it’s not. When groups of variables are passed together, the way x and y are in the example above, they are likely part of a concept that deserves a name of its own.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Argument Lists</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes we want to pass a variable number of arguments into a function. Consider, for example, the String.format method:</p>
<p class="calibre1">String.format("%s worked %.2f hours.", name, hours); If the variable arguments are all treated identically, as they are in the example above, then they are equivalent to a single argument of type List. By that reasoning, String.format is actually dyadic. Indeed, the declaration of String.format as shown below is clearly dyadic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">public String format(String format, Object... args)</p>
<p class="calibre1">So all the same rules apply. Functions that take variable arguments can be monads, dyads, or even triads. But it would be a mistake to give them more arguments than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">void monad(Integer... args);</p>
<p class="calibre1">void dyad(String name, Integer... args);</p>
<p class="calibre1">void triad(String name, int count, Integer... args);</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p9"><b class="calibre3">Verbs and Keywords</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Choosing good names for a function can go a long way toward explaining the intent of the function and the order and intent of the arguments. In the case of a monad, the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair. For example, write(name) is very evocative. Whatever this “name” thing is, it is being “written.” An even better name might be writeField(name), which tells us that the “name” thing is a “field.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This last is an example of the  <i class="calibre4">keyword </i> form of a function name. Using this form we encode the names of the arguments into the function name. For example, assertEquals might be better written as assertExpectedEqualsActual(expected, actual). This strongly mitigates the problem of having to remember the ordering of the arguments.</p>
