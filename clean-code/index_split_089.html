<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_176">Chapter 13: Concurrency</h2>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Producer-Consumer9</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">One or more producer threads create some work and place it in a buffer or queue. One or more consumer threads acquire that work from the queue and complete it. The queue between the producers and consumers is a  <i class="calibre4">bound resource</i>. This means producers must wait for free space in the queue before writing and consumers must wait until there is something in the queue to consume. Coordination between the producers and consumers via the queue involves producers and consumers signaling each other. The producers write to the queue and signal that the queue is no longer empty. Consumers read from the queue and signal that the queue is no longer full. Both potentially wait to be notified when they can continue.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Readers-Writers10</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When you have a shared resource that primarily serves as a source of information for readers, but which is occasionally updated by writers, throughput is an issue. Emphasizing throughput can cause starvation and the accumulation of stale information. Allowing updates can impact throughput. Coordinating readers so they do not read something a writer is updating and vice versa is a tough balancing act. Writers tend to block many readers for a long period of time, thus causing throughput issues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The challenge is to balance the needs of both readers and writers to satisfy correct operation, provide reasonable throughput and avoiding starvation. A simple strategy makes writers wait until there are no readers before allowing the writer to perform an update. If there are continuous readers, however, the writers will be starved. On the other hand, if there are frequent writers and they are given priority, throughput will suffer. Finding that balance and avoiding concurrent update issues is what the problem addresses.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Dining Philosophers11</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine a number of philosophers sitting around a circular table. A fork is placed to the left of each philosopher. There is a big bowl of spaghetti in the center of the table. The philosophers spend their time thinking unless they get hungry. Once hungry, they pick up the forks on either side of them and eat. A philosopher cannot eat unless he is holding two forks. If the philosopher to his right or left is already using one of the forks he needs, he must wait until that philosopher finishes eating and puts the forks back down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once a philosopher eats, he puts both his forks back down on the table and waits until he is hungry again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Replace philosophers with threads and forks with resources and this problem is similar to many enterprise applications in which processes compete for resources. Unless carefully designed, systems that compete in this way can experience deadlock, livelock, throughput, and efficiency degradation.</p>

<p class="calibre1">185</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most concurrent problems you will likely encounter will be some variation of these three problems. Study these algorithms and write solutions using them on your own so that when you come across concurrent problems, you’ll be more prepared to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Recommendation</b>:  <i class="calibre4">Learn these basic algorithms and understand their solutions. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Beware Dependencies Between Synchronized Methods</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dependencies between synchronized methods cause subtle bugs in concurrent code. The Java language has the notion of synchronized, which protects an individual method. However, if there is more than one synchronized method on the same shared class, then your system may be written incorrectly.12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Recommendation</b>:  <i class="calibre4">Avoid using more than one method on a shared object. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There will be times when you must use more than one method on a shared object.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When this is the case, there are three ways to make the code correct:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• <b class="calibre3">Client-Based Locking</b>—Have the client lock the server before calling the first method and make sure the lock’s extent includes code calling the last method.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• <b class="calibre3">Server-Based Locking</b>—Within the server create a method that locks the server, calls all the methods, and then unlocks. Have the client call the new method.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• <b class="calibre3">Adapted Server</b>—create an intermediary that performs the locking. This is an example of server-based locking, where the original server cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_000.html#p14"><b class="calibre3">Keep Synchronized Sections Small</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The synchronized keyword introduces a lock. All sections of code guarded by the same lock are guaranteed to have only one thread executing through them at any given time. Locks are expensive because they create delays and add overhead. So we don’t want to litter our code with synchronized statements. On the other hand, critical sec-tions13 must be guarded. So we want to design our code with as few critical sections as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some naive programmers try to achieve this by making their critical sections very large. However, extending synchronization beyond the minimal critical section increases contention and degrades performance.14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Recommendation</b>:  <i class="calibre4">Keep your synchronized sections as small as possible. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">12. See “Dependencies Between Methods Can Break Concurrent Code” on page 329.</p>
<p class="calibre1">13. A critical section is any section of code that must be protected from simultaneous use for the program to be correct.</p>
