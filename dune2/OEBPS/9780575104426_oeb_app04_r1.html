<p class="subtitle1"><em>The Almanak en-Ashraf<br/>(Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)</em></p>
<p class="normalz"><em>SHADDAM IV (10,134—10,202)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">The Padishah Emperor, 81st of his line (House Corrino) to occupy the Golden Lion Throne, reigned from 10,156 (date his father, Elrood IX, succumbed to chaumurky) until replaced by the 10,196 Regency set up in the name of his eldest daughter, Irulan. His reign is noted chiefly for the Arrakis Revolt, blamed by many historians on Shaddam IV’s dalliance with Court functions and the pomp of office. The ranks of Bursegs were doubled in the first sixteen years of his reign. Appropriations for Sardaukar training went down steadily in the final thirty years before the Arrakis Revolt. He had five daughters (Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa, and Rugi) and no legal sons. Four of the daughters accompanied him into retirement. His wife, Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank, died in 10,176.</p>
<p class="normalz"><em>LETO ATREIDES (10,140—10,191)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">A distaff cousin of the Corrinos, he is frequently referred to as the Red Duke. House Atreides ruled Caladan as a siridar-fief for twenty generations until pressured into the move to Arrakis. He is known chiefly as the father of Duke Paul Muad’Dib, the Umma Regent. The remains of Duke Leto occupy the “Skull Tomb” on Arrakis. His death is attributed to the treachery of a Suk doctor, and is an act laid to the Siridar Baron, Vladimir Harkonnen.</p>
<p class="normalz"><em>LADY JESSICA (Hon. Atreides) (10,154—10,256)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">A natural daughter (Bene Gesserit reference) of the Siridar-Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Mother of Duke Paul Muad’Dib. She graduated from the Wallach IX B.G. School.</p>
<p class="normalz"><em>LADY ALIA ATREIDES (10,191—)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">Legal daughter of Duke Leto Atreides and his formal concubine, Lady Jessica. Lady Alia was born on Arrakis about eight months after Duke Leto’s death. Prenatal exposure to an awareness-spectrum narcotic is the reason generally given for Bene Gesserit references to her as “Accursed One.” She is known in popular history as St. Alia or St. Alia-of-the-Knife. (For a detailed history, see <em>St. Alia, Huntress of a Billion Worlds</em> by Pander Oulson.)</p>
<p class="normalz"><em>VLADIMIR HARKONNEN (10,110—10,193)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">Commonly referred to as Baron Harkonnen, his title is officially Siridar (planetary governor) Baron. Vladimir Harkonnen is the direct-line male descendant of the Bashar Abulurd Harkonnen who was banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin. The return of House Harkonnen to power generally is ascribed to adroit manipulation of the whale fur market and later consolidation with melange wealth from Arrakis. The Siridar-Baron died on Arrakis during the Revolt. Title passed briefly to the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.</p>
<p class="normalz"><a id="page_894"/><em>COUNT HASIMIR FENRING (10,133—10,225)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">A distaff cousin of House Corrino, he was a childhood companion of Shaddam IV. (The frequently discredited <em>Pirate History of Corrino</em> related the curious story that Fenring was responsible for the chaumurky which disposed of Elrood IX.) All accounts agree that Fenring was the closest friend Shaddam IV possessed. The Imperial chores carried out by Count Fenring included that of Imperial Agent on Arrakis during the Harkonnen regime there and later Siridar-Absentia of Caladan. He joined Shaddam IV in retirement on Salusa Secundus.</p>
<p class="normalz"><em>COUNT GLOSSU RABBAN (10,132—10,193)</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1">Glossu Rabban, Count of Lankiveil, was the eldest nephew of Vladimir Harkonnen. Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha Rabban (who took the name Harkonnen when chosen for the Siridar-Baron’s household) were legal sons of the Siridir-Baron’s youngest demibrother, Abulurd. Abulurd renounced the Harkonnen name and all rights to the title when given the subdistrict governorship of Rabban-Lankiveil. Rabban was a distaff name.</p>
